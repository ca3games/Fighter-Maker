<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Tutorial authored by Mag Launcher for use with Fightermaker 2nd v1.02</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">(Please note, new information and techniques for use of this program are appearing all the time, as such, there will be additional updates to this tutorial (For real this time!!). Also, as this tutorial is authored by a normal user of this program, there may be areas that are left somewhat devoid of information.&nbsp; This simply means that I haven't finished testing yet.)</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Hello and welcome to my long overdue update to my Fightermaker 95 tutorial released roughly five years ago.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This tutorial covers the update to FM95 released back in 2001 entitled 2D Kakutou Tsukuru 2nd Round, referred to in english either as "Fighter Maker 2002" or "Fightermaker 2nd".</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As with the previous version, this program is a Japanese program.&nbsp; It was never domesticated into an English language version (It's a shame, isn't it?).&nbsp; Fortunately a few members of the community got together and translated the program so we can enjoy it!&nbsp; Thanks guys!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The format of this document&nbsp; will be fairly similar to my original tutorial.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Alright, after extracting the program to your desired directory you can get started.&nbsp; Open up the editor program, the icon for which looks like this.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="2dktlogo.png" WIDTH="55" HEIGHT="52" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">If this is the first time you've used the program you will come to a blank screen as well as four tabs at the top,</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>File</B>, <B>Test Play</B>, <B>Options</B>, and <B>Help</B>.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">To get started, click <B>File</B>, and select <B>New Game</B>.&nbsp; A prompt window should come up asking you to input a name for your project.&nbsp; Mine will be titled "Tutorial Project".</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="newgameprompt.png" WIDTH="354" HEIGHT="125" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you enter a name for the project, click <B>OK</B>.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">At this point, you will be shown the <B>Game System</B> tab.&nbsp; This tab has numerous settings for the "engine" your fighting game will run on.&nbsp; The <B>Basic </B>tab is discussed in this section.&nbsp; The other tabs are discussed </FONT><A HREF="#hs5000"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">here</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="gamesystem.png" WIDTH="486" HEIGHT="346" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Offset</B> checkbox allows you to toggle colliding attacks (via Samurai Shodown) on or off.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Stiff Time</B> actually refers to the game pause that happens under specific conditions.&nbsp; <B>Hit</B> means the pause when an attack connects, <B>Guard</B> means the pause when an attack is blocked, and <B>Offset</B> is a pause when two attacks collide. (This is usually a very heavy pause, i.e. higher value, to enhance dramatic effect.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The various checkboxes refer to:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Use Story Mode</B> - With this box checked, your game has a one player "Story Mode".&nbsp; Setting up a story mode is explained here.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Use Vs Mode</B> - With this box checked, your game supports two player Vs. mode.&nbsp; (I cannot stress how necessary this is... one player fighting games are teh suck.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Use Team Mode</B> - Checking this box allows your game to use a Team Vs. mode, somewhere along the lines of the King of Fighters, or Virtua Fighter series. (The latter being closer, due to the fact that there is no "Team Story Mode".)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>The Editor Won't Read the Game File</B> - Checking this box is a must to protect your work.&nbsp; This option does not allow the *.kgt file to be read by the editor after it is compiled.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Numbers Are Shown On the Life</B> - Checking this box places numbers next to each member of a team during Team mode.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Cursor Stays Until Game Starts </B>- From all experimentation I've found that this option sets whether or not your mouse pointer is active at startup of your game.&nbsp; Not entirely positive however.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Demo Sel</B> area is fairly self explanatory, but for sake of completeness, here are it's functions.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Title </B>- This is where you place the demo for your Title screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Character Selective 1P</B> - This is the demo for the character select screen in Single Player mode.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Character Selective VS Single</B> - This is the character select demo for Multiplayer Single Versus mode.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Character Selective VS Team</B> - This is the character select demo for Multiplayer Team Versus mode.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Game Over</B> - This is the Continue screen demo shown after a Game Over in Single Player mode.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Opening Demo</B> - This is the opening cinematic demo shown at game start.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">---------------</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Main Menu - Test Play</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><B><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The test play tab allows you to test your game's playability via a simple interface.&nbsp; The Test Play menu appears as such.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="testplay.png" WIDTH="387" HEIGHT="578" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The drop bars at the top are your character selection spaces.&nbsp; Click the dropdown button to select from a list of characters in the game. (Player 1 is default palette, Player 2 is secondary palette by default.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The second drop bars are player behaviors.&nbsp; The selectable behaviors available are:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Player </B>- This is the default setting.&nbsp; This means that the character selected is played by a human via keyboard or joystick.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>CPU</B> - This setting means that the character selected is operated via a set of artificial intelligence instructions.&nbsp; The process for setting up AI is discussed here.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Imitate</B> - This setting makes the character that is not operated by Player or CPU imitate the actions taken by the acting fighter.&nbsp; (I.e. - Player throws a jump kick, so does the CPU, etc.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Guarding</B> - This setting places the character in a state of auto-guard.&nbsp; All attacks are blocked (save throws) and the character cannot act otherwise.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Jumping</B> -&nbsp; This setting is similar to Guarding, except the character auto-jumps.&nbsp; This setting is generally good for testing juggles and attacks of that manner.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>BG</B> drop bar allows you to select a stage to fight in.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Start Play</B> refers to what section of the game is loaded to run.&nbsp; Either <B>From Title</B>, or <B>From Battle</B>.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>From Title </B>means the game will be loaded to the Title screen, allowing for you to test out each mode as if the game were being run as a stand alone executable.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>From Battle</B> loads up a single bout match between the two selected characters on the stage that was selected in the <B>BG</B> tab.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The&nbsp;<B> Game Speed</B> slider allows you to set the speed the game runs at.&nbsp; The default setting is 10, running the game at normal speed.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Game Time</B> allows you to set the number of seconds a fight runs, from 0 - 99.&nbsp; Setting the slider to 0 allows for an infinite amount of play time.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Setup</B> section allows you to enable various debug settings to view during the fights.&nbsp; While they have no true impact on gameplay, they give you information on how the game runs.&nbsp; You can often find solutions to a few glitches with these settings.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Status </B>- With this box checked, various status objects and meters will be shown on screen, this includes collision detection, current number of wins and losses, remaining hit points (in numeric value), character status (either Active, or Inactive, as well as standing, crouching or in air), as well as how many objects are currently on screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Show FPS</B> - With this box checked, a number will be shown on screen measuring frame output performance of your game.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Joystick</B> - With this box checked, your game will be able to use a joystick or control pad during play.&nbsp; In my opinion, this should never be left off.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Other Status</B> - Unfortunately, as of this writing, I have not seen what this feature actually does.&nbsp; It does not appear to display anything on screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That about does it for Test Play.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The backbone of a good fighting game are your tournament's combatants.&nbsp; A good balanced array of characters is what can set a good fighting game ahead of numerous mediocre attempts.&nbsp; This section will explain the basics to creating a fighter for use in your project.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Firstly, click the <B>Characters</B> tab at the top.&nbsp; This will bring you to the correct section of the editor.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This section also has a number of tabs to select from.&nbsp; The default tab should be the <B>SK</B> tab, where you edit your skills.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Alright, first thing we need to do is get some animations set up for our character.&nbsp; This is accomplished by loading 256 color spritesheet bitmaps and selecting images frame by frame.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, I would like you to organize your list of skills by adding markers.&nbsp; How do we do this, you ask?&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; Go to the first Hit Junction skill in your list and right click on it's name.&nbsp; A popup options menu should appear. (NOTE: This process is completely optional, but it allows you to keep your skills and animations in order for when you need them later.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="addskill.png" WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="126" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is your skill creation options.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on <B>Add &gt; New Skill</B> and you will be prompted to name your skill.&nbsp; Name this one <B>- Non-Descript Actions -</B>.&nbsp; I use this to keep various simple miscellaneous actions such as landing from a jump, bouncing on the floor after being knocked over, dashing and skidding, standing up, and things of that nature.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Move to your first Hit Junction skill again, and add another skill, name this one <B>- Hit Junctions -</B>. This will be where all your hit junction animations are organized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After that, go ALL THE WAY to the bottom of your skills list and add these skills in. (Each time you add one, move to the bottom of the list again to keep them in order)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>- Basic Attacks -</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>- Throws -</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>- Special Attacks -</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>- Super Combos - </B>(Super moves, SDMs, Hyper Combos, what have you. Super Combos is the term used in the Street Fighter Alpha series.)</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>- Objects -</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>- Hit Sparks -</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">and</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>- Dust Clouds -</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is your basic skills organization.&nbsp; I always do this to keep my characters skills list neat and organized.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Next, go to your <B>Standing</B> skill.&nbsp; This is a great place for us to start because you can use this animation as a base to line up all your other animations.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">At the bottom left of the editor window you'll see four buttons.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="animbuttons.png" WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="22" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on the <B>BMP</B> button, this will allow you to load up a bitmap image. Select your image and click <B>OK</B>.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A window will pop up looking similar to this:</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is where you select the frame you wish to add.&nbsp; Drag a box around the frame you wish to use.&nbsp; By default a frame box should auto-constrain around the frame.&nbsp; It will look like this.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">For now click the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="greennew.png" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="21" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> button, as we have no images to replace, and it'll help you get used to using that specific button (You'll be using it a lot).&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">It will place a box with an <B>I</B> in the center in the skill.&nbsp; (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="ibox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">).&nbsp; This is an <B>Image </B>marker.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Animation - Adjusting Frames</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You'll want to align your frames well so that your animations hold together and frames don't needlessly slide back and forth.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is accomplished using the <B>Axis</B> settings in the image properties area.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="alignment.png" WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="133" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The first value is the frame's <B>X</B> (Horizontal) value, the second is the frame's <B>Y</B> (Vertical) value.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Simply adjust the values until you're happy with them.&nbsp; Continue the operation on each frame of your skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is also a good time to mention that the <B>ANI</B> button (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="anibutton.png" WIDTH="39" HEIGHT="22" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">) is used to preview your animations.&nbsp; A new window will pop up allowing you to see how everything looks.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After this is finished, you'll need to adjust the timing of each frame.&nbsp; You can adjust this in the Image properties area as well.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="imageproperties.png" WIDTH="258" HEIGHT="74" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Wait</B> value is the timing of your frames.&nbsp; A value of 100 is roughly equal to one second, whereas a value of 0 is a constant loop.&nbsp; The default value is a setting of 5, which is almost always too fast.&nbsp; Adjust the value up or down to your liking.&nbsp; (You may need to wait a bit to adjust the speed for your jumping animations)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>I</B> section is a number value representing the image used in the current frame, every time you add an image, an extra number is available for use.&nbsp; Think of it like a storage area.&nbsp; This allows you to reuse frames in other animations without uploading the same one over and over again.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Complete this process with all your basic animations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Alright.&nbsp; You should have all your animations compiled by this point. (If you haven't done so, check </FONT><A HREF="#hs2010"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">this section</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, of course, are the basics.&nbsp; I will be explaining how exactly all your movement options work, then move on to the application of these basics.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Go to your <B>Forward </B>skill, then right click on the first square.&nbsp; A long dropdown options menu should pop up.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on <B>Add &gt; Move</B>.&nbsp; A small box with an <B>M</B> in it should appear (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="mbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">), similar to the <B>Image</B> box.&nbsp; This is your movement box.&nbsp; This will allow your character to move via specified values.&nbsp; At the left side, where your Image properties usually are, is the Movement Properties section.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="movementproperties.png" WIDTH="253" HEIGHT="249" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is the area of the editor that will allow you to edit the values that create movement.&nbsp; The values are:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Move</B> <B>X</B> and <B>Y</B> - These values represent actual movement.&nbsp; <B>X</B> is of course, horizontal movement, and <B>Y</B> is vertical movement.&nbsp; The higher the values, the more extreme the movement.&nbsp; If these numbers are a positive value, <B>X </B>will move forward, and <B>Y</B> will move down.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Gravity X</B> and <B>Y</B> - Similar to the <B>Move X,Y </B>values, these control the degree of horizontal and vertical movement.&nbsp; The difference is, these apply to gravity rather than actual movement.&nbsp; They create a drag on the character in a direction specified by their numerical values.&nbsp; A negative in the <B>X</B> value will result in a backward pull on your characters movement (this is good for slowing a character down during a run, for example.)&nbsp; A negative in the <B>Y </B>value will result in an upward pull, basically sending your character toward the sky.&nbsp; There aren't many uses for a negative <B>Y </B>gravity value.&nbsp; The opposite is true as well.&nbsp; Positives in either value will result in either a forward pull on your character, or a downward pull on your character (One of the most useful applications of the gravity field).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, onto the applications of movement.&nbsp; Basic movement (walking and jumping) are the only movements covered in this section.&nbsp; For other applications, (dashing, etc.) check the Advanced Techniques section.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click </FONT><A HREF="#hs2021"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">here</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> to move on to Creating Motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>This manual was created with the free trial version of <A HREF="http://www.helpscribble.com/">HelpScribble</A>.<BR>This notice will not appear in manuals created with the full version.</FONT></P>
<BR><BR><BR>
<A NAME="hs2021"></A>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Dealing With Movement - Creating Motion</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now that you understand the basics, it's time to get down to creating.&nbsp; Walking will be first.&nbsp; Go to your <B>Forward</B> skill if you're not there already, and click on the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="mbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> box to bring up your movement properties.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, there's a bit of variation necessary here.&nbsp; The actual speed of movement you want really depends on the size of your character, and what seems to work best for them.&nbsp; I typically stick to a value between <B>+2.50</B> and <B>+5.00</B> for any and all ground movement.&nbsp; However, it seems in the case of Rockman, that this will not work in all cases.&nbsp; His walking works best at a value of <B>+4.25</B>, which almost tops off my personal maximum of <B>+5.00</B>.&nbsp; As I said it really depends on your character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Anyway, after you've clicked on your <IMG SRC="mbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"> box, left click on the <B>Move X</B> value.&nbsp; This will increase the numbers.&nbsp; Set it to something comfortable and then move to your <B>Backward</B> skill.&nbsp; Place an <B>Add &gt; Move</B> box at the beginning of the skill if you haven't already.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Characters in fighting games don't typically retreat as fast as they advance, so you'll need to set this to a slightly lower value (<B>NEGATIVE</B> value, that is) proportional to the original forward movement.&nbsp; For Rockman, I set his value to <B>-3.90</B>, but it's all up to personal preference.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="anibutton.png" WIDTH="39" HEIGHT="22" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> button to preview your movement.&nbsp; You should notice the background grid is moving.&nbsp; This allows you to check if your values have been set correctly and that your character isn't doing some bizarre moonwalk.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rockmanmove.png" WIDTH="638" HEIGHT="540" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you get everything comfortable, we can move on to Jumping.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, go to your <B>Jump Up</B> skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Here is where we need a little more variation.&nbsp; I typically have at least one frame at the beginning that shows the character preparing his jump.&nbsp; If you have one of these, right click the second image in the skill and <B>Add &gt; Move</B>.&nbsp; This will make sure the character is still grounded while preparing his jump.&nbsp; If you do not have a frame like this, add your </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="mbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> box at the beginning of the animation.&nbsp; It won't cause any problems if you use either method, it's merely a matter of preference.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The process for creating movement is very similar, except the majority of the movement is handled by the <B>Move Y</B> value, and this time we will also be using the <B>Gravity Y</B> value.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Here you can use a pretty strict standard as far as movement settings.&nbsp; I typically set my vertical values anywhere between <B>-10.00</B> and <B>-11.50</B>.&nbsp; This works in this case.&nbsp; I set Rockman's <B>Move Y</B> value to <B>-11.50</B>, exactly at my limit.&nbsp; I cannot stress enough that the <B>Move Y</B> value for a jump has to be a <B>NEGATIVE</B> value... It won't work correctly otherwise.&nbsp; I typically stay away from anything over <B>-11.50</B> because the jumps start to get way too floaty at that point.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Anyway, now we need to apply gravity to the jump to bring your character back to the floor.&nbsp; I ALWAYS set my <B>Gravity Y</B> value to <B>+0.60 </B>when dealing with jumps.&nbsp; ALWAYS!&nbsp; It's a good comfortable falling speed for this application.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you're finished with that, copy and paste the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="mbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> box from <B>Jump Up</B> into both your <B>Front Jump</B> and <B>Back Jump</B> skills, this gives us a base to edit for each of those skills.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Leaving both <B>Y </B>values identical, in your <B>Front Jump</B> place a positive value in your <B>Move X</B> value.&nbsp; Keep it fairly similar to your <B>Forward</B> walking movement, or slightly less (I set Rockman's to <B>+4.40</B>).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rockmanjump.png" WIDTH="257" HEIGHT="255" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Do the same thing with your <B>Back Jump</B> skill, except replace the <B>Move X</B> value with a negative value.&nbsp; This value can be identical to or slightly more than your <B>Move X</B> value from your <B>Walking Backward</B> skill. (Rockman's is <B>-4.00</B>)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rockmanbackjump.png" WIDTH="257" HEIGHT="255" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That about does it for your movement.&nbsp; However, as an aesthetic choice you can create a <B>Landing</B> skill to occur after your jumps hit ground.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Add a new skill to your list called <B>Landing</B> or something to that effect, then create a landing animation.&nbsp; Make sure it causes a noticeable pause after the jump lands. (Typically an animation with a <B>Wait</B> time total of <B>6</B> is a good amount of time.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Then, go back to your <B>Jump Up</B> skill and right click the first box in the skill.&nbsp; Hover over <B>Add &gt; Condition Fork</B>, and a sub-menu should pop up.&nbsp; Click on <B>[DS] Add &gt; Detect Skill</B>.&nbsp; A box with a <B>DS</B> should appear in your skill (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="dsbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">).&nbsp; This allows you to set a condition telling the character to go to a specific skill when certain conditions are met.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="detectskill.png" WIDTH="258" HEIGHT="106" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The conditions that are able to be used with this object are</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Not</B> - This is a placeholder - It does nothing.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Landing </B>- This condition is met when a character hits the ground after being in the air for any reason.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Attack Hits</B> - This condition is met when an attack you have thrown lands successfully.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Defending</B> - This condition is met when you block an attack.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Hit the Wall</B> - This condition is met when your character is touching either outside "Wall" of a stage while moving.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>In Offset</B> - This condition is met when both your and your enemy's attacks collide.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>While do Throw</B> - As of this writing, I am unsure of what this does.&nbsp; I've never particularly found a use for it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you select one of these options, the dropdown below will light up.&nbsp; The dropdown bard allows you to select the skill you wish to move to, while the number beside it allows you to select a specific frame in the skill to go to.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Set this to <B>Landing</B> <B>0</B>.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, every time you land after jumping up, it should go to this animation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Copy and Paste the </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="dsbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> </B>box to both your <B>Front Jump</B> and <B>Back Jump</B> skills, and you're done!</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Okay, we're into important stuff.&nbsp; This is the FIRST thing you should do when starting a project, as it will make your life so much easier during character creation.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The reason for this is that after you've set up your hit junctions/common images list, when you add a new character to your game, they will be pre-loaded with each of the hit junction skills necessary to work in that project. These skills are of blank, of course, but it means you don't need to add a thousand different skills to a character by hand.&nbsp; It will also set up your hit junctions for you in your character's Hit Junction tab.&nbsp; That way all you have to do is select the junction you want to use when setting up attacks.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Hit junctions and Common Images allow you to create the reactions characters have to being hit by attacks, be they punches, kicks, throws, or off the wall special attacks, here's where the basic fundamentals lie.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You may have already noticed you've got some hit junction animations available to you in the Skill Editor,</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Standing Wk Hit</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Crouching Wk Hit</B></FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Crouching Sg Guard</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>and Jumping Sg Guard</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">These are your general basic hit junctions, they are animations set up so characters can get hit by weak and strong attacks while either standing, jumping or crouching.&nbsp; They also have guarding animations to allow the character to block.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is all well and good, but we know any good fighting game has to have MANY more of these hit junctions to function correctly.&nbsp; I have a basic list of these that I use for everything, I call it the "FM06 Standard Junctions" list, referring to the </FONT><A HREF="http://maniax.silverfirebird.com"><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="3">Fighter Maniax</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> website that my friend and I run.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This list is as follows (It's pretty long... so I've grouped some of them together.&nbsp; But any time you see a word group separated by a comma, those are each separate hit junctions.)</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Seems pretty daunting, doesn't it?&nbsp; At first, yes.&nbsp; But you don't necessarily need all of those hit junctions.&nbsp; These are a universal list I use to start each of my projects, and remove them as necessary.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, in order to add these, click on your <B>Game System</B> tab, then click <B>Hit Junctions</B>.&nbsp; You should see the original list I mentioned at the top.&nbsp; You can rename these as I did, or leave them alone.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, to add a hit junction, right click on the list and a small options window should pop up.&nbsp; Click on <B>Add &gt; Hit Junction</B> and you will then be prompted to name it.&nbsp; Do this repeatedly until you have every hit junction you think will be necessary for your project.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Here is the list shown in image form to make it easier to grasp.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="hitjunctions.png" WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="1027" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Yes, that is definitely a lot of hit junctions, but don't worry, in the long run, it saves you just that much more work.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can probably tell, each of the hit junctions have been named for the property of attack, and the state the character was in when it got hit. They're pretty self explanatory, but for sake of user friendliness the properties of my hit junction list are as follows.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Hit</B> - is for physical bludgeoning attacks like those with fists and feet, the only exception is when it is followed by the words "Special Attack" or "Super Attack" these are universal hit junctions for most special attacks that don't cause an added effect (fire, electricity, etc.)&nbsp; Hit Crouched Attack means that the character has been struck while standing by an opponents crouching attack, typically a weak kick or any variety of punch.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Slashed</B> - is for characters who scratch or slice, either with bladed weapons, a'la Vega/Balrog from the Street Fighter series, or with their hands, a'la Iori, or K9999 from the King of Fighters series.&nbsp; Typically these are just the "Hit" hit junction animations used with a different hit spark.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Face Plant</B> - is used when a character's feet are knocked out from under them, usually by some form of sweeping attack that knocks them forward.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Lit On Fire</B> - is used when a character's clothing/body are ignited after an attack.&nbsp; Ground means the character slides back while on fire, but does not fall over, Air means the character is knocked back slightly while on fire, generally as a result of being hit while jumping.&nbsp; Launched means the character is either sent backwards or straight up while on fire, typically it is straight up.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Knocked Down</B> - means a character has been knocked off their feet.&nbsp; Light, medium and heavy are all varying degrees of falling distance and height.&nbsp; For example, a character being hit by low sweep kick would use Knocked Down Light, a character being hit by a standard uppercut would use Knocked Down Heavy, and a character hit by a Shoryuu Ken/Dragon Punch would use Knocked Down Special Attack.&nbsp; A lot of these can also be used for throws too, but it seriously depends on the throw.&nbsp; If you can't use these specifically for throws, you can set up hit junctions later to do so.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Knocked Back Flung</B> - means a character has taken a hit that knocks them either straight back at a wall, or a very long distance backward.&nbsp; It's usually a crowd control tactic to get aggressive players off of you.&nbsp; A good example is Chun-Li's Sou Hakkei palm thrust from Street Fighter Alpha 3 (X-ism only.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Sucked In</B> - means the character is drawn in toward an attack.&nbsp; The most famous example of which is Ryu's Shinkuu Tatsumaki Super Combo from the Street Fighter Alpha games, he jumps up and starts to spin, and if his leg clips the other player, they are drawn in for extra hits.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Sucked In Reverse</B> - is a followup to Sucked In, this junction turns the character around, allowing for them to be pulled back the other direction so the attack will function correctly.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Guard</B> - is just that, guarding.&nbsp; It is used to create a "Blocked" junction.&nbsp; An animation that results from blocking an attack.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After I've set up my list, I typically go into my character that I'm editing and delete the "Slashed" skills, as well as the "Hit By Special/Super Attack" skills.&nbsp; The reason for this is you can use the basic "Hit" animations to achieve the same effect.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">It's mostly a memory saver, so you don't have to if you don't want to.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">There are definitely more uses for Hit Junctions, but I've pretty much given you the universal standard of most fighting games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Next, on to Common Images.&nbsp; Common images are images shared by each character in a fighting game. These are essentially the same as Hit Junctions, but they can be used for a number of things.&nbsp; I typically use common images during throws.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You don't really need that many of them, I usually only need about six or seven.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Go to your <B>Game System </B>tab, if you're not there already, and click on <B>Common Images</B>.&nbsp; You'll notice an interface that's fairly similar to the Hit Junctions tab.&nbsp; Right Click on the white space that is your Common Images list, and a prompt should once again pop up asking you what you'd like to do.&nbsp; Click on <B>Add &gt; Common Image</B> and you'll once again be prompted to name it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I typically use <B>Thrown 1</B>, <B>Thrown 2</B>, etc.&nbsp; In the case of Street Fighter characters, I MAY include a few for the <B>Shun Goku Satsu</B> special attack. (This typically is used for when the character is caught, then during the actual attack, then when they're on the floor at the end.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I also include a <B>Blank</B> common image in case I need it for anything.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">To set up your Hit Junction animations, simply click on one of the spaces that says ---------None--------.&nbsp; A dropdown menu containing all your skills should pop up.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Common images are generally used during throws allowing a character to be clutched and pulled in various directions.&nbsp; This is a very basic use of course, and it's good to come up with your own ways of using these tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This section simply explains how one would set up these images for use in your project.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you've got your list finished as explained in the previous section, click on your <B>Characters </B>tab, then click on the <B>Common Images</B> tab.&nbsp; A window looking like this should appear.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This window allows you to set and position images for use as Common Images.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Image Number</B> area allows you to set the image associated with use of Common Images.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The values next to this are the Images <B>X</B> and <B>Y </B>position values, used much the same way as before, to position your image as needed.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">With your <B>Blank</B> image, set the image number to 8191 (the maximum allowed), this allows you to keep the common image blank, no matter how many images your character will end up with.&nbsp; Even in a very well animated character, the chances of even having 2000 images in total are slim to none.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">For further images, simply use the <B>Image Number</B> value to scroll through your available images, and position them as necessary, like so.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Nothing to it, right?&nbsp; As you may be able to tell already, this image is the perfect startup for the character being thrown.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Finish out all your other common images as necessary by looking at situations that may need them, and you're pretty much set.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Collision detection is a very important thing.&nbsp; This is what allows your game to function as more than just moving pictures on a computer screen.&nbsp; The act of placing collision blocks around your characters has been streamlined tremendously over previous iterations of the program, and are useable via a simple skill object, rather than applying conditions directly to the animation itself.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Right click on a skill, and the dropdown options menu will appear.&nbsp; There are two collision options you have available.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Add &gt; Defense Frame</B> - Used for collision involving taking hits, stopping movement, etc.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Add &gt; Attack Frame</B> - Used for hit detection and application of Hit Junctions.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After clicking on either of these, one of two boxes will appear on your skill bar.&nbsp; An <B>FD</B> box (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="fdbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">), signifying a defense frame, or an <B>FA </B>box (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="fabox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">), signifying an attack frame.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">If there isn't an <B>FA</B> box in a particular skill, it will always come preceded by an <B>R </B>box (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">), signifying a Reaction.&nbsp; This box is where you place your Hit Junctions.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First off, I will explain the types of collision detection available to use.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">To set the property of a defense frame, click on any combination of the three property boxes to the left of the editor window.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="defenseproperties.png" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="286" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>M.</B> <B>Number </B>- refers to layering occupancy.&nbsp; Any two defense or attack frames with the same value will cancel the one before it out, allowing you to move frames within an animation.&nbsp; However, if the numbers don't match, you can have more than one collision frame in an animation simultaneously.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Ratio</B> - Acts as a damage percentage.&nbsp; 100 is full damage, 0 is no damage, etc.&nbsp; So if you have a character with some type of super armor special technique or the like, you can allow them to take less damage while it is active.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The four numbers beneath are <B>X </B>and <B>Y</B> values.&nbsp; The top two refer to frame positioning, while the bottom two refer to frame size.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="nonechecked.png" WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="206" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>No Property</B> - This defense frame has no properties associated with it.&nbsp; It is basically a placeholder frame.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="striking.png" WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="207" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>Striking</B> - This defense frame creates the effect of your characters being solid. It is used when you want your characters not to be able to pass through each other, yet when struck by an attack, take no damage.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="doing.png" WIDTH="184" HEIGHT="205" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>Doing</B> - This defense frame allows for hit detection only.&nbsp; When a defense frame has only the <B>Doing</B> property, it can be passed through, but still take damage when struck.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Collision Detection - How to Apply</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Applying collision detection to your characters is an important step, but it's not a difficult one.&nbsp; You simply need to know what properties you want associated with what animation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">For now, we'll only cover the basics.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on your <B>Standing</B> skill, and right click the first square.&nbsp; The dropdown options menu will appear.&nbsp; Now click on <B>Add &gt; Defense Frame</B>.&nbsp; A </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="fdbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> box will appear and should be already highlighted.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on the <B>Striking</B> and <B>Doing</B> Properties (or click <B>Throwing</B> as well if you wish), and simply drag a box around your current frame.&nbsp; Take care not to extend it too far out past the edges of your character.&nbsp; In fact, try to simply frame the main body of your character.&nbsp; This is to make sure your collision detection isn't too loose, and that your characters can get fairly close together.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You should see a green hued frame appear around your image, like so.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="collisionframe.png" WIDTH="173" HEIGHT="164" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">If this is similar to what you see, congratulations.&nbsp; You have applied collision detection to your character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">In the case of Rockman, this animation is finished, as he merely stands and blinks, not moving a muscle.&nbsp; As a result, the first collision frame will carry over correctly to the rest of the animation.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">However, if your character is like, say, Ken, from Street Fighter Alpha 3, you'll notice he kind of slides back and forth a bit.&nbsp; In a situation like this, simply right click on the frame that requires a new collision brick, and repeat the process.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This technique is used on any irregular animations, typically jumps, and most attack animations.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="multicollision.png" WIDTH="497" HEIGHT="331" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see in the skill bar, there are multiple defense frames used, due to Rockman changing basic shape multiple times throughout the jump.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Another trick to collision detection is the ability to fine tune it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rockmancrouch.png" WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="131" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You might notice that Rockman's arm and foot are sticking out fairly far past the defense frame.&nbsp; The arm we're not particularly worried about, but the foot is a problem.&nbsp; Simply right click on the frame that needs it, and insert another defense frame, only this time, increase the <B>M.</B> <B>Number</B> by 1.&nbsp; Then click on the <B>Doing</B> property ONLY.&nbsp; This will allow us to drag another frame that will act simultaneously with the first one.&nbsp; Simply drag a small box over the offending area.</FONT><BR>
<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You may not be able to see it well due to color, but a blue defense frame is over Rockman's foot.&nbsp; This will allow it to accept damage, but not keep the characters from getting close together.&nbsp; I left the Defense properties in the image to better explain what I did to achieve this.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Certain animations may require different properties to work as they should.&nbsp; The <B>Striking</B> property for example should be used with hit junction animations that aren't comboable, such as being knocked over by an attack.&nbsp; The <B>Doing</B> property is used for hit junctions you wish to be able to have a character pass through, the Sucked In hit junctions are perfect examples of this, because the characters each move through each others space.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That's how to apply collision detection to a character.&nbsp; Attack frames are handled exactly the same way, but are explained in full detail elsewhere.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Simply repeat this process on all your animations (except for ones like Victory, Loss, Start, etc where collision detection could possibly hamper things) using any properties you deem necessary and then we can move on once more.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Creating Your Fighter - Creating Basic Attacks</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Since this is a fighting game, we need attacks.&nbsp; This section will teach you all about how to take a basic animation, and allow it to be used as an attack in your game.&nbsp; This will cover punches, kicks, and throws.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, add your skills for your attacks to your skills list if you haven't already.&nbsp; Apply collision detection as necessary, and then click on the frame that you wish to deal damage.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Right Click and <B>Add &gt; Attack Frame</B> to this image.&nbsp; Click on the <B>FA</B> box that appeared behind the image you selected, and drag a box around the appendage necessary.&nbsp; A red box should appear.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rockmanjab.png" WIDTH="251" HEIGHT="189" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This box tells the program that the selected appendage is what causes damage to other fighters.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">At the left side of the editor window are your attack properties.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="attackproperties.png" WIDTH="261" HEIGHT="278" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is a list of options available to you for editing aspects of your attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>M. Number</B> - is identical to the option for Defense Frames, it allows you to negate or overlap defense frames within the same animation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Power</B> - is used to determine the strength of an attack, the value set is equal to the number of hit points removed from the opponents energy bar.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Cancel</B> - allows an attack to chain into another attack after it hits.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>No Detection </B>- causes the attack not to be detected by the <B>Detect Skill</B> condition fork.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Cont. Hits </B>- allows for the same attack to hit multiple times.&nbsp; Typically after an attack lands, the rest of the collision is nullified so the attack will hit only once.&nbsp; With this box checked, each Attack frame within the skill will count toward damage.&nbsp; This is particularly useful for multi-hit projectiles and super attacks.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>No Sky Decision</B> - means the attack will not affect characters who are in the air.&nbsp; This is a good thing to use for throws and things of that manner.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Guard Fail</B> - renders the associated attack unblockable. Use with extreme caution as this can unbalance a character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>While Guard</B> - contrary to the Guard Fail property, this attack only works against guarding opponents.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>While Receiving</B> - this acts as a sort of counter attack system.&nbsp; Attacks with this property are only effective if you've taken a hit before using them.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Shave</B> - Attacks with this property still do a small amount of damage when blocked.&nbsp; This property is typically used for special attacks.&nbsp; The damage done by the attack when blocked is equal to 1/8 of it's original strength.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The four numbers at the bottom are <B>X </B>and <B>Y</B> values and work exactly the same way as they do with Defense Frames.&nbsp; The top two are positioning, while the bottom two are size.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Set the power of your attack as well as any properties associated with it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, to remove the attack frame when necessary, right click on the frame after the image you applied the attack frame to and simply <B>Add &gt; Attack Frame</B> once more.&nbsp; This will apply a blank attack frame with the same <B>M. Number</B> as the previous one and negate it.&nbsp; This way you don't have straggler collision later in an attack.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Applying Reactions is the next step.&nbsp; Click on the <B>R</B> box behind the first <B>FA </B>box (if one isn't there, right click and <B>Add &gt; Reaction</B>).&nbsp; A Reaction Properties area will be to the left of the editor window.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="reactionproperties.png" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="224" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This area is fairly self explanatory.&nbsp; Each dropdown bar allows you to apply a Hit Junction to a corresponding situation.&nbsp; Simply apply the junctions as necessary, like so.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="reactionsset.png" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="220" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This tells your characters how to react to the attacks they've been hit by.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Repeat this process with all your basic attacks. Next, we move on to throws.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click </FONT><A HREF="#hs2051"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">here</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> to move on.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Basic Attacks - Throws</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">In order to keep our fighting game more diverse, we should attempt to include throws.&nbsp; Not only because they're practically a staple of all fighting games at this point, but because they can be used for multitudes of things, from stopping a turtling opponent, to getting out of a corner when dealing with aggressive opponents.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">To start, we'll need a "Grabbing" animation of sorts, basically a startup animation for our throw.&nbsp; So you'll need to add a new skill.&nbsp; If you've organized your skills the way I do, go to your throws section and add a new skill.&nbsp; You'll be prompted to name it, of course, and since Rockman uses a Shoulder Throw, I'll call mine "Shoulder Throw Start".</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, all we're going to have in this animation is a single frame with a Wait time of 1.&nbsp; The image you want can either be a standing frame, or the very start of the throw animation (I prefer this way).&nbsp; You don't necessarily need a collision detection square around this, since you're not going to see it very long, but you can opt to use a <B>No Property</B> frame if you wish.&nbsp; Do not use anything with the Striking property though, as we want to make sure our characters can stay close together.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rockmanthrowstart.png" WIDTH="494" HEIGHT="258" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Set it up? Good.&nbsp; Now we need to give it a way to connect.&nbsp; As with any attack, we want to <B>Add &gt; Attack Frame</B> on this frame to let it connect with the other character.&nbsp; Simply drag a large box, possibly sticking out slightly from your characters arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="throwattackframe.png" WIDTH="285" HEIGHT="212" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, in the Attack Properties section, the only thing you want to change is the <B>Guard Fail</B> property, as we don't want damage done yet, but we want to be able to grab our opponent even when he's blocking.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="throwproperties.png" WIDTH="262" HEIGHT="269" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Alright.&nbsp; Now we want to animate our throw.&nbsp; Add a new skill in the Throws section named accordingly, mine will be Shoulder Throw.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you've named it, fill in appropriate images.&nbsp; Then go back to your Starter animation.&nbsp; Delete the reaction box, as it won't be necessary.&nbsp; Right click on the first box in the line and <B>Add &gt; Condition Fork - [DS] Detect Skill</B>.&nbsp; In the dropdown box, set the condition as <B>Attack Hits</B> and tell it to go to frame 0 of your throwing animation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After that's done we're going to need our opponents to actually get thrown, so that's where our common images come in to play.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">On the first frame, right click and select <B>Add &gt; Successful Partner Hit Management - [RC] Change Shapes Condition</B>.&nbsp; This allows us to use our common images to move our opponent as we'd like.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">At the left side of the editor window are your Common Image Properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="commonimageproperties.png" WIDTH="259" HEIGHT="283" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Position</B> - These are once again, <B>X</B> and <B>Y </B>position values, X being horizontal, and Y being vertical.&nbsp; This time, they control the position of your opponents common image within your skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Common Image</B> - this dropdown bar is where you select what common image you wish to use.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Depth</B> - This allows you to control the opponents position in relation to your character.&nbsp; <B>In </B>means behind the character, and <B>Out </B>means in front of your character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Turn X, Turn Y, and Same</B> - These check boxes allow you to rotate the common image being used.&nbsp; <B>Turn X</B> turns it left and right, <B>Turn Y</B> turns it up and down, and <B>Same</B> negates relative direction, meaning the frame will look the same regardless of whether your opponent is on the left or right side.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Sample Character</B> - This is the character shown in your animations when you're editing your common images.&nbsp; It allows you to see how the character will look during your skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Set your Common Image to Thrown 1, and drag it to the position you need.&nbsp; Click the Turn X checkbox as you'll want your characters facing each other.&nbsp; Typically in this situation the "Depth" of the character is <B>In</B>, meaning behind the attacker.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">If all goes well, your result should look something like this.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="throwimage.png" WIDTH="511" HEIGHT="323" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Add any common images where you need them and set them as necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After this, we're going to need to be able to actually THROW the character.&nbsp; This is done with another hit junction.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Chances are, you don't have a corresponding hit junction to go with the throw you're using.&nbsp; The reason for this is that most throws don't look anything alike, so there's no way to have a basic hit junction prepared.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">So, click your <B>Game System</B> tab, and then your <B>Hit Junctions</B> tab, and add a new one.&nbsp; Mine will, of course, be called "Shoulder Thrown".</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you've done this, go to your characters skills list, and scroll to the Hit junctions section, and add a new skill named the same way as your hit junction.&nbsp; You're almost done.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, click on your CHARACTER'S hit junctions tab and set the animation to your corresponding hit junction.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Alright, not too bad, was it?&nbsp; Now, go back to your blank animation and create the animation for being thrown.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, at this point you want to add the damage to your throw, so at the start of this hit junction animation, right click and select <B>Add &gt; Gauge - Change Gauge Value</B>.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the left, as usual, are the Gauge Change Properties.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="guagemod.png" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="219" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">These are completely self explanatory.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, you want to modify <B>YOUR</B> life guage at this point.&nbsp; Simply set a negative value in the <B>Yours</B> life guage section.&nbsp; Simple as that!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="guageset.png" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="190" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now that we've got our hit junction set up.&nbsp; Go back to your throwing animation and right click on the frame you want the character to let go of who he's throwing.&nbsp; On the dropdown menu, select <B>Add &gt; Successful Partner Hit Management - [RP] Change Skill</B>.&nbsp; This allows us to make our opponent go to a specific hit junction when we want them to.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As usual, you have your property set up to the left of the editor window.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="partnerproperties.png" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="276" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The options remain fairly similar to <B>[RC] Change Shape's Condition</B>.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Position</B> - Adjust the <B>X </B>and <B>Y</B> values to position the character at the time of the hit junction.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Hit Junction</B> - This dropdown bar allows you to select the specific hit junction you want the opponent to go to.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Depth</B> - Let's you adjust whether the opponent is behind (<B>In</B>) or in front (<B>Out</B>) of the character performing the main action (i.e. Throwing).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Turn X</B> - This time, the only option you get is whether to turn left or right on the horizontal plane.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on the Hit Junction dropdown bar and select your appropriate hit junction.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="hitjunctionthrow.png" WIDTH="509" HEIGHT="305" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Hit the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="anibutton.png" WIDTH="39" HEIGHT="22" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> to test your throw.&nbsp; If all goes well, you should see your character throwing a copy of himself.&nbsp; If not, simply check the steps one more time and see what happened.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That's the basics on creating a throw.&nbsp; There are other methods (such as using nothing but <B>[RP]</B> boxes, but I find this method a little more efficient as you need fewer stored animations per character and common images work just as well in most cases.)</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Basic Attacks - Commands</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, we need to make our fighter work, right?&nbsp; In order to achieve this, we need to set commands to each skill used.&nbsp; The only things that don't need commands are jumping, crouching, walking, and if you set your hit junctions correctly, blocking.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on the <B>Commands</B> tab for your character and you'll be presented with the ever familiar blank list.&nbsp; In order to add commands, simply right click and you'll be prompted to <B>Add &gt; Command</B>&nbsp; This is a fairly self explanatory option.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you click it, you'll be prompted to name your command.&nbsp; Simply name them in accordance with the skill you wish to use.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>NOTE:</B> There is some importance in how you create these.&nbsp; The higher a command is on your list, the more priority it has as a skill.&nbsp; You'll want your super moves and things like that at the top, and all your basic attacks at the bottom, like so.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="skillpriority.png" WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="345" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see, Rockman's Hyper Combos are up at the top of the list, and the basic moves, such as dashing and normal attacks, are at the bottom.&nbsp; This is <B>VERY </B>important!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You may also note that I typically keep my skills fairly organized, with the name coming first and the strength coming second.&nbsp; This is merely personal preference, but it helps me find what I'm looking for much faster.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You've got a few things to look at on the skill command setup screen:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="commandinputarea.png" WIDTH="241" HEIGHT="378" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Command Time </B>- This is pretty simple.&nbsp; This determines the length of time you have to enter the command for your attack.&nbsp; A value of 10 is equal to roughly 0.1 seconds, whereas 100 is a full second.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Set Commands </B>- Is the area where you put your actual attacks.&nbsp; Click on the drop bar and you'll be able to select from all the skills you've created.&nbsp; Each dropdown bar is for a different situation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Air</B> - Is used for a skill executed while jumping.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Stand</B> - This used to be <B>Stand (Close)</B> back in FM95.&nbsp; This is where you place all those up close variations of attacks that the Street Fighter series is ever so fond of. The actual distance of how close is close can be set in the&nbsp;<B> Basic</B> character tab, under the <B>Interv</B> value.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Stand Far</B> - This is obviously used when an attack is executed from a greater distance back than <B>Stand</B>.&nbsp; Most of your ground skills will use this command situation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Crouched</B> - Is used for any attacks executed while holding down on the joystick.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Command Comp</B> - Is a shortened form of <B>Command Composition</B> and means exactly that.&nbsp; This is where you put together the actual commands for your attacks.&nbsp; There are a few things to look at here as well.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>"E" Box (</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="ebox.png" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">)</B> - This box means that this is the end of the command.&nbsp; Simply place this on the last line of your command.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>"More" Arrow Box (</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="morearrow.png" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">)</B> - This box means that the command continues on until it reaches the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="ebox.png" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">.&nbsp; To place this in your commands, simply click on the first <IMG SRC="ebox.png" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"> and it will appear in it's place.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>"Free" (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="free.png" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">)</B> - This is a freebie space in the command.&nbsp; If you place these between each line of your command you can make your game a little more keyboard friendly.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>"Wait" Dot</B> <B>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="waitdot.png" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">)</B> - This is a call back to the Tekken/Virtua Fighter series of games and simply means leave some space between one part of the command and the next.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>"Input" Arrows</B> <B>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="inputarrows.png" WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">)</B> -<B> </B>These are the input arrows for your commands.

Simply click a few more times.</FONT><BR>
<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Command Differentials (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="repeatdifferential.png" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">,</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="holddifferential.png" WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">,</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="blankdifferential.png" WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">)</B> - Anybody remember the pesky kanji from FM95? No? Well good, it was a pain and a half to figure out what those did... Differentials is the name that I give to the three options you have next to your buttons.&nbsp; This is because they do just that, they change the input method of your command.&nbsp; The first (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="repeatdifferential.png" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">) refers to repeatedly pressing the key on the corresponding line, the second (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="holddifferential.png" WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">) refers to holding the key down, used for chargeup attacks like anything Guile can do.&nbsp; The third one (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="blankdifferential.png" WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">) is a bit of a mystery, however, if it's anything like FM95, it's a rotation differential.&nbsp; It's used for 360° command input.&nbsp; This is incredibly useful for command grapplers. Simply click on the blank box next to your buttons either once, twice, or three times to select a differential.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Line Input Time/Value (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="lineinput.png" WIDTH="63" HEIGHT="21" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">)</B> - This is a bit strange.&nbsp; If you place the Hold differential on a command line, this acts as a typical timing value.&nbsp; If you use the Repeat or Blank (hypothetically) differentials, it is used as a tally for how many times the command has been input.&nbsp; Simply adjust the timer as you see fit.&nbsp; Note that if you do not apply a differential, it will be darkened and unusable.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now that that's done, select the command you wish to edit from your list at the side.&nbsp; Then apply everything to it, like so.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="commandcomplete.png" WIDTH="236" HEIGHT="376" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is a finished command.&nbsp; It tells Rockman to use the "Item Attack (Strong)" skill whenever the command <B>Down, Forward+FP</B> is entered and the command has slightly less than 0.2 seconds to be entered.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Simply repeat this process until sick on each of your skills.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Alrighty, now we're almost done with our fighters.&nbsp; One of the first things we want to do is create hitsparks to create a flashy impact for our characters' attacks.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Create a new skill for your hitsparks, I typically use this list:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Light Physical Attack Spark</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Light Physical Slash Spark</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Middle Physical Attack Spark</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Middle Physical Slash Spark</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Heavy Physical Attack Spark</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Heavy Physical Slash Spark</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Special Attack Spark</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Super Attack Spark</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Block Spark</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That should just about cover the basic necessities, but feel free to add more if you'd like.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on the spark you would like to edit and click the <B>BMP</B> button to open up a bitmap.&nbsp; Load the bitmap you wish to use.&nbsp; Now, before you select anything click on the <B>Private Palette</B> (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="privatepalette.png" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="22" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">) button on your loaded bitmap.&nbsp; This will allow your hitsparks to keep their own universal palette uncontrolled by your player character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, simply select and insert all your hitspark frames into your skill.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Be sure to center the images on the crossed white plane lines, like so:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="hitsparkcentered.png" WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="226" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This will place the hitspark correctly in relation to where an attack made contact.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Do this with each of your hitsparks, and then click on your good old <B>Hit Junctions </B>Character tab.&nbsp; We can finally edit that whole empty side.&nbsp; Click on the dropdown bars and select your hit/guard sparks from the list and apply them to each of their corresponding hit junctions.&nbsp; By the end of the process, your list should look something like this:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="completedjunctions.png" WIDTH="579" HEIGHT="1027" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Notice the only difference between the "Hit" and "Slashed" Junctions are the hitsparks.&nbsp; This is a fundamental trick to cut down on character size when you want to put a character up for download.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That's about all there is for hitsparks, really, just go with your imagination and do what you see fit!</FONT><BR>

<A NAME="hs2062"></A>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Finishing Touches - Adding Sound to Animation</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Good sound design makes a fighting game.&nbsp; When you land a hit on someone you want to hear that satisfying "thwack" that tells you your attack connected.&nbsp; You want to hear the loud thud when a character hits the pavement.&nbsp; It's all about developing an atmosphere.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Character voices, while not necessary, lend an air of completeness to your project as well.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This small section will tell you how to add these ever important sound effects to your character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The basic principal is the same throughout your project, so I only really need to explain this once.&nbsp; Go to an animation that you want to add a sound effect to.&nbsp; I'm going to Rockman's Standing Jab.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Right click on the frame you want your sound to play on and you'll be treated with that ever familiar dropdown menu.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on the <B>Add &gt; Sound</B> option and a box with an <B>S</B> (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="sbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">) will appear on the area you clicked.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">With this box highlighted, you'll notice that once again, at the left side of your editor, you will have a number of options to choose from.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="soundsetup.png" WIDTH="257" HEIGHT="248" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is your Sound Properties utility.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Sound Select</B> - is a simple dropdown menu that lets you select from the various sounds you've already uploaded into your project's database.&nbsp; You'll notice ------None------- in the dropdown box because we have not uploaded any sounds, nor have we selected any to go with the animation.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">(<B>NOTE: </B>It is very important that if you do not intend to have a sound, that you do not have a sound box in your animation, because if you do, the ------None------- in the sound properties will make your entire game go silent.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Loop to Point</B> - This checkbox allows you to loop a sound.&nbsp; Loop to point actually means loop to start, as there is no way to set a "point" for the sound to go back to.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>CDDA</B> <B>Track</B> - tells the editor what track to load from a CD in your CD-Player.&nbsp; This function only operates if you choose CDDA as your sound type.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Test</B> section is pretty obvious:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Play</B> - allows you to play the currently selected sound from the dropdown bar.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Stop</B> - stops the sound while it's playing if you've selected to test it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Add File</B> section doesn't need much explanation either, however, for sake of a user friendly tutorial, I will do so anyway.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>WAVE</B> - this actually refers to the <B>.WAV</B> format of sound file for the Windows operating system.&nbsp; It simply means "Upload recorded sound effect in .wav format".</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>MIDI</B> - refers to synthesized audio generally created with a midi sequencer.&nbsp; This is usually used for music, but due to the generally low quality, I stick to .WAV audio.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>CDDA </B>- This lets you play a track from a music CD.&nbsp; The premise is somewhat cool, if lacking in functionality.&nbsp; The reason being, that it will load a track from a CD currently in the drive, not store the track for future use.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Delete</B> - should be obvious.&nbsp; This button allows you to delete the currently selected sound file from the dropdown bar.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Anyway, since we're loading a sound effect for an attack (at least I am, anyway), click on the <B>WAVE</B> button in the <B>Add File</B> section.&nbsp; This will open up a folder and allow you to browse your computer for sound effect files you wish to upload.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Select your sound and press Open.&nbsp; You will then be prompted to name your sound effect (or music if you clicked <B>MIDI</B>)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="namesound.png" WIDTH="337" HEIGHT="111" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">By default it will have the name of your file as the name in the prompt, which if you named them all accordingly shouldn't be a problem.&nbsp; However, feel free to rename the sound to anything you wish and press OK.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Select your sound (if the editor hasn't done so already) in the dropdown bar and then go ahead and test your animation.&nbsp; The sound effect should play while the test is running.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, since the sound itself is already loaded into the database, you can use the same sound in your editor multiple times without having to repeatedly load the file, easy huh?</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now wash, rinse and repeat with all the sound effects you plan on using in your animations!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A quick note on testing the animations.&nbsp; If two sounds run into each other during the animation test, the one that plays second will interrupt the first sound.&nbsp; This is not a big deal however, because the two sounds will work just fine in your actual project.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Finishing Touches - Adding Objects to Animations</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">We're in the home stretch now, folks!!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Objects can be used for all sorts of things, from projectile attacks, to special effects on various skills.&nbsp; Heck, I've used them to allow a fighter to summon his dog!&nbsp; It's all up to you how you plan to use them.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I'll be adding the energy flare to Rockman's Rock Upper special attack.&nbsp; This somewhat differentiates it from being a basic Shoryuu Ken.&nbsp; First, if you've organized your skills list like I went over at the beginning of this tutorial, go to the section you entitled as <B>- Objects -</B> and move down one skill.&nbsp; Right click and select <B>Add &gt; New Skill</B> and name the object you wish to create.&nbsp; From here, create the animation for this object as you would for any other skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now here's how we put them into play.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Go to the skill you wish to add the object to.&nbsp; Right click on the frame that you want the object to appear on and once again, you see the familiar dropdown menu.&nbsp; Click on <B>Add &gt; Object</B> and a box with an <B>O</B> (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="obox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">) will appear in your skill bar.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Once more at the left of your editor (and by now I bet you're either really tired of this part, or have figured this stuff out enough that you don't need this explanation, lol) is your <B>Object Properties Utility</B>.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="objectsetup.png" WIDTH="255" HEIGHT="272" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Position X, Y </B>- is self explanatory.&nbsp; These are the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinates for your object.&nbsp; This tells them where to appear during your skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Object</B> - This dropdown bar is where you select the animation to be used as your object.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Parent</B> - This checkbox means the object will follow the object that created it.&nbsp; Useful for things such as the fire on Ken's Shoryuu Ken or the Flare on Rockman's Rock Upper (which is the example I am using).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>UnCond</B> - Or Unconditional, means the object cannot be removed via layering with a blank object, or by hitting the floor.&nbsp; This object stays on screen until the animation is finished, or until another event (usually determined in the object's skill by a <B>DS</B> <B>&gt; Detect Skill</B> command) occurs.&nbsp; This is very useful for fireball type objects that you don't want to disappear for no reason while on screen.&nbsp; Use this property wisely however, as you'll want to make absolutely sure you don't want to be able to cancel out the object in question.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Shadow</B> - This checkbox simply means that the object created will have a shadow&nbsp; underneath it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Pic X Y</B> - Is a bit of a misnomer.&nbsp; This should probably say Screen X, Y, but that's neither here nor there.&nbsp; This checkbox allows you to place an object relative to the play area, rather than relative to your character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>M. Number</B> - I'm still not sure what exactly the "M" means, but this is used for object layering.&nbsp; You can set the number from zero to nine.&nbsp; This simply tells the editor not to destroy one object if another object (with a different M. Number) appears on screen.&nbsp; However, if you create two objects with the same M. Number value, one will cancel the other out.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Depth</B> sections simply control if the object is in front of or behind other objects.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>In</B> - The object is created behind the player characters.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Out</B> - The object is created in front of the player characters.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Point</B> - Allows you use the <B>Depth Ap</B> option to specify object depth.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Depth Ap</B> - Lets you select specifically what the depth of the object created is relative to other objects (0 being the farthest back, 127 being farthest forward.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>It's Out</B> - Is another bit of a misnomer.&nbsp; Technically this could be called End of Object Skill.&nbsp; What this function does is tell the player character to go to a specific animation that you select via the dropdown bar after the object's animation ends.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Anyway, set your object's properties the way you intend for the specific skill.&nbsp; This is how mine ended up.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="objectsetupfinal.png" WIDTH="405" HEIGHT="269" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see, my object is "Rock Upper Flare", set to a depth of "Out" with a "Parent" property and no "It's Out" condition.&nbsp; This means the object will follow Rockman, and will be in front of him.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As for the X, Y coordinates, you can either set these via the two numbers, or you can just click and drag on the editor field to move the crosshair to the specific spot you wish the object to appear.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That's pretty much it for objects. Use them for whatever you'd like.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Check your animation to see if everything worked the way you intended it to.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">(A quick side note, you're going to want to place a blank object at the start of all your hit junctions.&nbsp; This will eliminate any objects that would be left over after your character takes a hit, unless of course, the object has the <B>UnCond</B> box checked.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">If you want to make a projectile attack, it's covered in Advanced Techniques, as there's a bit more to do to the object in question to make it work the way it's intended.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is your basic properties for your character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Sex</B> - Obviously refers to your characters gender. Select from Male, Female, Both, or None.&nbsp; This isn't entirely necessary, as in most cases, no one will see this information. (Unless they downloaded the character from the internet, of course.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Age</B> - Refers to how old a character is.&nbsp; This isn't particularly necessary to place either, but I do it anyway.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Neutral Guard</B> - This checkbox is used for Autoguard situations a'la the Street Fighter Alpha/Zero series.&nbsp; Typically, you want to leave this off, because if it's checked, the character will automatically block all attacks if standing still.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Sky Guard </B>- Could be translated as Air Guard, but that's just nitpicking.&nbsp; With this box checked your characters will be able to block attacks while in the process of jumping.&nbsp; Very useful, and in my opinion, an absolute necessity unless you're trying to make your game feel like Street Fighter II.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Vs. Mode</B> - This allows the character to be played in Versus Mode.&nbsp; Leave this box unchecked for characters such as endgame bosses (i.e. ANYTHING from the King of Fighters series).&nbsp; In most cases however, you will want this box checked.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Gauge</B> section allows you to edit various properties for your characters Life and Super meters.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Life Gauge Max</B> - This lets you set the total number of "Hit Points" if you will, that your character has.&nbsp; This can be set anywhere from 1 to 1,000.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Special Stock Max</B> - Lets you edit the maximum amount of super meter levels a character has.&nbsp; This can be set from 0 to 9.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Special Gauge Max</B> - Lets you set the total number of points required to fill up a super gauge.&nbsp; This can be set from 1 to 1,000 as well.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Starting Stock</B> - Refers to the number of full super gauges the character has at the beginning of the first round of a fight.&nbsp; This can be set from 0 to 9 as well.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Life Rev.</B> section is a bit of an odd one.&nbsp; I can't figure out exactly why the names are translated the way they are, but it's not a big deal.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Start Pos</B> - Actually refers to a section on the life bar to which a damage buffer will be added after so much damage has been taken by the player.&nbsp; A perfect example of something like this is Jin Saotome from Marvel Vs. Capcom.&nbsp; When he's down to one fifth of his total life bar, he starts into a super armor mode and takes half damage.&nbsp; The number at the side refers to a percentile, Zero meaning the buffer is unused, and 100 meaning a full life guage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Correction</B> - Refers to how effective the buffer mentioned previously actually is.&nbsp; Zero basically takes all damage and reduces it by 99%, while 100 makes the buffer virtually ineffective.&nbsp; Note, the percentile values are likely somewhat inaccurate, but not by much.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Special Gauge Increase</B> - This section controls how much is added to your special gauge when various conditions are met.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>When Attack Hits</B> - Refers to the amount of points added to your special gauge when one of your character's attacks make contact.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>When Enemy Hits</B> - Obviously refers to the amount added to your special gauge when you're hit by your enemy.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>S. Ratio </B>- This stands for Shave Ratio (according to the notation anyway).&nbsp; This value controls how much damage the enemy character will take when blocking attacks that shave damage (any attack with an attack frame that has the "Shave" box checked).&nbsp; When this number is left at 0 the damage is reduced to 1/8 of it's original total, whereupon if the number is 100, even if blocked the attack will still deal full damage.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Char. Rev. </B>- According to the notation, this stands for Character Revision.&nbsp; What this actually does however, is shave off a portion of damage after a specific number of hits in a combo land.&nbsp; I'm not sure of the exact ratio, but it seems to work sooner the higher this value is set.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Interv.</B> - Or "Interval" determines what is considered "Close" by the program.&nbsp; I typically set this to somewhere around 90 which pretty much means the characters have to be damn near touching each other to be able to perform "close" attacks such as throws.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Y Pos. of SideHP</B> - This actually refers to the small lifebar that appears on your enemy if you click on the "Show Life" checkbox for your story mode setup.&nbsp; This value sets the Y (vertical) coordinate for this small life bar.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Guard Button</B> - Remember Mortal Kombat?&nbsp; Well that ain't what this does.&nbsp; What this actually does is give you the ability to make a sort of single plane Super Smash Brothers type fighting system.&nbsp; The reason for this is your character doesn't automatically turn around when changing sides.&nbsp; You can face either direction at any given time.&nbsp; The Guard button can be used like the barrier button from SSB/SSBM.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That just about covers it for the basics tab.&nbsp; More useful than you though, eh?</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><HR></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This specific part of character creation has eluded many people, even since the days of FM95 has this feature caused trouble.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; It's incredibly vague.&nbsp; You set up some numbers and you're left with a big dark line and absolutely no clue what that line represents.&nbsp; Well, I'm here to fix that for you.&nbsp; Hopefully I can make it simple to understand using some of the AI data I assembled for CAPCOM - Mini Melee.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">To get started, click on the CPU tab for your character.&nbsp; You'll be greeted with a hefty blank window with a white space at the left side.&nbsp; The white space is the area for all your CPU commands.&nbsp; Right click it and you'll be prompted with a small menu to either <B>Add a new CPU Pattern</B>, <B>Rename</B> an old CPU pattern, or <B>Delete</B> a CPU pattern.&nbsp; Click on the <B>Add a new CPU Pattern</B> option.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Just like with your players and skills, you'll be prompted to name it.&nbsp; Simply go with what you're planning on telling the computer player to do.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After naming the CPU Pattern, you'll see at the side that another properties area has appeared.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="cpupatternsetup.png" WIDTH="238" HEIGHT="375" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This would be your CPU Pattern Properties utility.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Cond</B> (Condition) area controls what conditions must be met to trigger the CPU to act.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Prob </B>- Or "Probability" is a percentile representation of how often a computer character will perform this specific action.&nbsp; This value can be set between 0 and 100 (reflecting 0% and 100% probability)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Character Is In The Air</B> - This is a bit misleading.&nbsp; By "Character" it refers to the CPU player.&nbsp; This means that in order for the CPU to perform the action, it's character must be in the air.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Enemy Is In The Air</B> - This means that the player not controlled by the CPU must be in the air for the action to be performed.&nbsp; This is typically a good one to use for jumping attacks, or anti-air maneuvers such as the Shoryuu Ken.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Interv.</B> (Interval) section tells the CPU within what distance to perform the actions in the Pattern.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Empt.&nbsp;</B> - Refers to the start of the covered distance the action will be performed (0 meaning right next to the opposing player, with the gap increasing the higher the value is set.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Inside</B> - Refers to the maximum range past the <B>Empt.</B> value the action will be performed.&nbsp; Note, the Inside value MUST be a higher number than the Empt. value.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You'll notice that when both the Empt. and Inside values are set, they produce a thick black line in the center window.&nbsp; This gives you an idea of distance cover relative to the screen (scaled down, of course) that the character will perform the action.&nbsp; You can use this to set up multiple versions of the same attacks but execute them from different distances from the opposing player.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Sk</B> (skill) section is where you set the specific action you would like the CPU to perform.&nbsp; You can set up combos by placing multiple attacks in, or you can tell them to move, and for how long by simply adjusting values and directional inputs similar to the way you created commands for your attacks.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is a snippet I've created for Dan from Mini Melee.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="cpucrouchfierce.png" WIDTH="241" HEIGHT="373" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This shows that Dan has a 26% chance of throwing a crouching fierce punch while in the vicinity of 0 to 130 from the opposing player.&nbsp; The Down arrow in the Sk section makes him crouch, while the Fierce Punch skill selected makes him attack.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Here's what the center window looks like.&nbsp; I can't show you the actual CPU pattern names, as they'd give away Dan's programming, but I can show you what your finished AI might look like</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="dancpu.png" WIDTH="490" HEIGHT="640" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see, he's got a number of moves that he'll only perform up close (the closer to the left the end of the black bar is, the less amount of distance apart the characters will need to be.)</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You'll notice also, that some of his CPU patterns will be executed from anywhere on screen (the extra long black line.&nbsp; The "Inside" value was set much higher than the "Empt." value, setting a large cover distance for the CPU pattern.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I know it's still somewhat vague, but the information should help you.&nbsp; If you've still got some problems, you can find me on a couple </FONT><A HREF="#hs20"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">FM message board communities</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">.&nbsp; Don't hesitate to ask for help!</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You'll want additional palettes for your characters so that when the same characters fight each other, you'll be able to tell which is which.&nbsp; Each character can have up to eight palettes (You don't necessarily need this many, but it doesn't hurt to be thorough).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Editing palettes is fairly easy, and if your bitmap doesn't have too many colors, takes no time at all.&nbsp; In your Skills editor, click on the button that looks like a painter's palette (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="palettebutton.png" WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="22" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">) at the bottom of the editor.&nbsp; This will bring up a palette window for your character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="playerpalette.png" WIDTH="419" HEIGHT="347" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You'll see the eight buttons at the top that tell you which palette you're currently editing (1p - 8p).&nbsp; As well as 3 other function buttons.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Dark To Light (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="darktolight.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">)</B> - Clicking this button organizes your palette from darkest to lightest colors.&nbsp; Typically though the results are frustratingly hard to work with, but if this is your cup of tea, by all means, go for it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Palette Order (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="paletteorder.png" WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">)</B> - Clicking this button arranges your color palettes from Monochrome, to Red, to Green, to Blue, in that order, with shades going from light to dark.&nbsp; This is a fairly useful button for when your palette is a bit uncategorized.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Edit (</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="paletteedit.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">)</B> - This button opens up the color editor.&nbsp; I never find much need for it, as double clicking a color produces the same result.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, click on your 2p button and double click the color you wish to change.&nbsp; This will bring up the custom color interface used by most windows based paint programs</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="windowscoloredit.png" WIDTH="453" HEIGHT="331" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Much like in any other paint program, simply click in the window to select the color you want.&nbsp; It couldn't be simpler.&nbsp; Now, wash, rinse and repeat for all the character palettes you want!</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Okay, let's get started.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on the <B>Stages</B> tab in your editor and you'll be treated with a very familiar window.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Looks exactly like our character creation screen, doesn't it?&nbsp; That's because it's nearly identical.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Start by right clicking in the white field to the left and then click <B>Add &gt; Stage</B> to create a new stage from scratch.&nbsp; (<B>Add &gt; Stage From File</B> allows you to load a stage you've downloaded or created in a different project.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You'll once again be prompted to name your stage.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Since I'm creating Rockman for this tutorial, I'll create his stage from Marvel Vs. Capcom as well, Dr. Wily's Fortress.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you name your stage, you'll notice that a "skill" will appear in your stage editor.&nbsp; It should read <B>Player Layers</B>.&nbsp; This is exactly what it sounds like.&nbsp; This is the layer occupied by the player characters and cannot be edited.&nbsp; You can however use it to measure the depth of objects (we'll get to that later).</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">At the top, you'll also notice two tabs:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Script </B>- This tab is where you store all your graphics and stage "skills".&nbsp; This is where most of the work on your stage will come to fruition.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Basic</B> - This tab let's you set the background music (BGM) for your stage.&nbsp; Simply select a sound from your stage's sound bank in the dropdown bar (you must add a sound in your actual stage first, then you can select it here.&nbsp; After you do so, you can delete the sound box from your skill).</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">It works well, but is semi-obsolete, as there are better techniques out there to produce more arcade-faithful style music in your stages.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Sure, you can have a stage with a single layer.&nbsp; That's perfectly fine.&nbsp; But if you want your stage to look like a more professional effort, you're going to want multiple layers for background, and maybe even one or two for a foreground effect.&nbsp; This page will discuss how to achieve this. It's really not difficult.&nbsp; Just follow along and find out!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, right click on the <B>Player Layers</B> skill and click <B>Add &gt; New Skill</B> just as you would when creating a fighter.&nbsp; You'll once again be prompted to name this skill.&nbsp; Simply name it something that coincides with the image that you'll be using for your backdrop.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="layername.png" WIDTH="337" HEIGHT="111" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Wily's Factory is actually the name of the bitmap I'll be loading, so this helps me keep track of what layer corresponds with what image.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Simply click the <B>BMP</B> button at the bottom and open your image as if you were creating a fighter.&nbsp; Upload it into your layer.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Your <B>Image Properties </B>utility will appear at the left side of the editor window as usual, with a number of functions to use while editing your stage.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="stageimageproperties.png" WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="190" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is fairly similar to the Image properties when editing an animation frame for your character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Wait</B> - refers to the amount of time the frame of animation stays on screen. (a value of 100 being roughly 1 second.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>I</B> - or "Image Number" if you will, shows the current number value given to the image uploaded in your stage's image bank.&nbsp; Since the number 0 is showing, this means it's the first image uploaded for your stage.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Axis</B> - This lets you control placement of your image.&nbsp; The first number is, of course, the <B>X</B> (horizontal) coordinate, while the second value is the <B>Y</B> (vertical) coordinate.&nbsp; Adjust these to your liking.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Turn X </B>- This checkbox allows you to flip the image horizontally, mirroring it from left to right.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Turn Y</B> - This checkbox flips the current image vertically, turning it upside down.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, let's move on to multiple layers.&nbsp; Click </FONT><A HREF="#hs3021"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">here</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> to continue.

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First thing you'll probably notice is that the image is a bit too large for the stage frame (the grey lines that form a box in your editor window).&nbsp; This isn't a big deal (Yet!).&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="toobig.png" WIDTH="622" HEIGHT="590" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see, the actual stage stretches past the bottom of the bounding box.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You can simply edit this placement with the <B>Axis</B> values in your image properties, or by clicking and dragging the image itself.&nbsp; This is not the best idea right now however, as you're going to likely need to repeat your work later if you do this now.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Anyway.&nbsp; We're going to want multiple layers to create an image of depth in our stage.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You can achieve this by creating multiple skills on top of one another in front of and behind the <B>Player Layers</B> skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="stagelayers.png" WIDTH="345" HEIGHT="123" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You'll notice that there's no layers below the <B>Player Layers</B> skill.&nbsp; This is because Rockman's MvC stage has no foreground layers.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A rule of thumb for stage layering is, the closer to the top of the list, the farther back it is.&nbsp; Go by this rule, and you'll be perfectly fine.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Creating Stages - Creating Scrolling</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Alright, now for the finishing touches to stage creation.&nbsp; Now that we've got all our layers set up, we'll learn how to create a parallax scrolling effect.&nbsp; Go to the first layer on your stage (in my case, Wily's Factory), and click on the name.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">At the left side of your editor window, the <B>Layer Properties</B> utility should now be displayed.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="layersetup.png" WIDTH="257" HEIGHT="181" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You don't have many options, but they're all pretty important.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>L R Connect</B> - This checkbox repeatedly tiles your background layer horizontally.&nbsp; This is typically used for stationary backdrops such as sky.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>U D Connect</B> - This checkbox tiles your background layer vertically, more often then not, you'll pair this with L R Connect.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>Scroll</B> section is really what we're looking for, however.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Width</B> - This checkbox allows you to set the horizontal scrolling for your stage.&nbsp; The number at the side will control how fast the stage scrolls sideways.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Length</B> - This checkbox allows you to set the vertical scrolling for your stage.&nbsp; This makes the stage move up and down when your characters jump.&nbsp; The number at the side once again controls how fast the scrolling will occur.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, check both the <B>Width </B>and <B>Length</B> checkboxes.&nbsp; On this layer, set both values to <B>100</B>.&nbsp; This is the optimum setting for your basic layer, as it will scroll at the speed your character moves.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You'll notice the bounding box around your stage frame in your editor got larger.&nbsp; This is why I mentioned earlier not to move the frames.&nbsp; Using the bounding box as the entire border for your stage, you can align your layers so they display correctly on screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the layer I'm currently on, I'm going to align the bottom of the image with the top of the bottom line of the box, this will keep the floor where I need it to be.&nbsp; You can also move the image horizontally if you need to center your stage in the play window.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, in Rockman's stage, unfortunate to say, there isn't any parallax scrolling, as it's just one big layer on top of some backdrop effects (smokestacks, what have you.).&nbsp; But that doesn't stop me from explaining how to create the effect in your own stages.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Following the same procedure you used to create your initial scrolling, click the check boxes for the next layers back.&nbsp; Now, you'll need to reduce the Width and Length values accordingly, as land farther back on the horizon will scroll more slowly than anything toward the front.&nbsp; The amount you need to decrease is entirely dependent on how many layers are in your stage.&nbsp; If you've got a typical stage, you'll have around 4 layers (the ground, the mid horizon, the far horizon, and the sky).&nbsp; If this is the case, you'll set the mid horizon's <B>Width</B> to around <B>35-40 </B>and the <B>Length</B> to around <B>50-65 </B>(Note, this is also VERY dependent on how high your characters jump, so some testing will be in order.)&nbsp; For the next layer back, the far horizon, set the <B>Width </B>to around <B>15-18</B>, and the <B>Length</B> to around <B>35-45</B> (once again, judging for jump height).&nbsp; Now, if your last layer is the sky, just leave it alone.&nbsp; A stationary sky produces the effect we're looking for.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I know it seems a bit complicated, but with some tweaking, you'll figure it out and be producing rolling landscapes in no time!</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>2D Fightermaker 2nd - Creating Demos</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is more of a subsection than anything, so I will keep it short.&nbsp; The reason is, if you've paid attention while creating characters and stages, you'll have no problem whatsoever creating demos because the process combines both.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">What are demos?&nbsp; Well, it depends.&nbsp; They're used for a number of things.&nbsp; The exact list however can be found in the <B>Game System, Basic</B> tab of your project.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The barebones uses for demos are</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Title</B> - This demo is your title screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Character Selective 1P</B> - This is your character select screen for single player modes (call it "Arcade" if you have no plot, or "Story" if you do.&nbsp; This isn't totally necessary, but it's nice to let people know if you've got a plot in your game.&nbsp; Call it whatever you wish.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Character Selective Vs. Single</B> - This is your character select screen for your basic one on one versus mode.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Character Selective Vs. Team</B> - This is your character select screen for Team Vs. Mode (if you choose to include one.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Game Over </B>- This is actually a demo used for a Continue screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Opening Demo</B> - This demo is used for an opening cutscene for your game.&nbsp; This is often called an "Attract Mode" screen by those in the arcade game business, because all the flashy imagery was intended to attract players to put quarters in the machine.&nbsp; You can use this to show off graphics, explain game story, whatever you want.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That's the basic list for your demos.&nbsp; However, you can also use them for in-game cutscenes, credits sequences, and things of that nature that can be used during story mode.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">One thing that's a bit strange to most players is creating a character select demo.&nbsp; I'll explain the steps to do so here..</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First,&nbsp; your character select screen backdrop and import it to the editor as a demo.&nbsp; Place this in any of the <B>Character Selective</B> dropdown bars in your Game System, Basic tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, you may notice a "<B>Char. Selection Picture</B>" tab at the far right.&nbsp; Click this tab.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="charselect.png" WIDTH="459" HEIGHT="200" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You will be presented with the following editable values:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Character Start Position X, Y</B> - This tells your game what position to place the first portrait on your character select screen.&nbsp; X being horizontally, and Y, being vertically.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Distance Between Character X, X</B> - This is a typo.&nbsp; It should be X, Y.&nbsp; This tells your game how far apart to place each portrait on your character select screen, X being horizontally, and Y being vertically.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Columns and Rows in Select X, Y</B> - This tells your game how many portraits to place in each row (from 1 to 50. 50 being the maximum number of characters your game can have) and how many columns of portraits there are (also from 1 to 50.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Player 1 Cursor Position X, Y </B>- This tells your game where Player 1's character select cursor starts, with the X value being the horizontal coordinate, and Y being the vertical.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Player 2 Cursor Position X, Y</B> - This tells your game where Player 2's select cursor starts.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Player 1/Player 2 Selection Width X, Y </B>- I'm unsure as to what these actually do.&nbsp; I've played with the values a number of times, but they haven't done anything.&nbsp; I would assume they tell teh cursor how far to jump each time a direction is pressed.&nbsp; I will update this entry if I figure anything more out.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Simply adjust these values and you'll be all set.&nbsp; Just place your character select demos in their appropriate spots.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A quick note on how characters are ordered on the select screen.&nbsp; Characters are displayed on the screen from left to right, then up to down, going down the list in the order the characters were created.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">For example, you've got six characters, and for ease of argument, we'll use the first six characters on the Marvel Vs. Capcom select screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B><IMG SRC="list1.png" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="147" BORDER="0"></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">If your Characters list was in this order, and your character select screen had 3 columns and 2 rows, your character order would show up on screen as such -&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="example1.png" WIDTH="292" HEIGHT="132" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is the exact order used in the game.&nbsp; However, if your characters list were rearranged like say, this -&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><B><IMG SRC="list2.png" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="147" BORDER="0"></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Using the same settings as previous (3 columns, 2 rows)&nbsp; Your new selection order would show up as thus -</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="example2.png" WIDTH="292" HEIGHT="132" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">See?&nbsp; It takes the order of the Characters list and places them in order from left to right , up to down.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You'll get it if you practice long enough.&nbsp; It's not too difficult a concept to grasp.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Anyway, that's about it for demos!</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>2D Fightermaker 2nd - Dealing With Scripts</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">When most gamer types hear the word "Scripts", what comes to mind is program code.&nbsp; That's not the case here.&nbsp; What scripts are is the functional and decorative accouterments that complete your fighting game.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Click on the <B>Basic Scripts</B> tab under the <B>Game System </B>section and you'll be greeted with another empty skills window, except this time, there are actually skills in the list.&nbsp; If you scan this list, you'll see you have a number of options, many of them are self explanatory.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="scriptslist.png" WIDTH="859" HEIGHT="574" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The full list and their functions is as follows:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Hit Letter "Hit"</B> - This is where the "Hits" graphic goes following the numbers used for number of hits in a combo.&nbsp; There's a technique in the advance section that makes this obsolete, however.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Hit Number 0-9</B> - These are your combo hit numbers.&nbsp; Once again, there's an advanced technique that makes these obsolete.&nbsp; (Mainly because the hit counter system used in this program is mediocre at best.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Offset Hit Mark</B> - Treat this like a hit spark.&nbsp; This is the spark that appears when two attacks collide with each other. (Assuming you've allowed Offset hits in your game.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Round Ani. Start Time</B> - This doesn't require a graphic, clicking on the name allows you to set the amount of time that must pass before a round officially starts.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Round Ani. End Time</B> - See above.&nbsp; This let's you set the amount of time that passes before the next round starts. (In the case of the final round, how much time before the battle ends.)&nbsp; Meaning that after a victory, there will be an amount of time for victory poses, etc. before the next round starts.&nbsp; Set this here.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Round 1-9 </B>and<B> Final Round</B> - These are your "Round #" graphics.&nbsp; Usually accompanied by an announcer yelling out what round it is.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Spirits</B> - A mistranslation.&nbsp; This should actually be "Fight".&nbsp; This is where the graphic for the word "Fight" that appears after the round announcement appears.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>K.O.&nbsp;</B> - The graphic used for the "Knockout" words at the end of a round.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Perfect</B> - The word graphic that appears on screen in the event that you win a round without taking damage.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>You Win</B> and <B>You Lose </B>- These are the Win/Loss word graphics that appear on screen during single player mode.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>1p Wins</B> and <B>2p</B> <B>Wins</B> - These are the Win word graphics used in Versus mode.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Draw</B> - This is the graphic that's used for a round that ends in a Time Over.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Double K.O.</B> - This graphic appears on screen at the round's end if both players are defeated at the same time.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Unlimited Sign</B> - This is a graphic used for when the timer is set to Infinite.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Time Numbers 0-9</B> - These are the number graphics used for your timer.&nbsp; (Clicking on the name will allow you to set the spacing between the two digits.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Special Stock Numbers 0-9</B> - These are the number graphics used to show how many stored special guages you've earned.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Victory Mark On</B> - This is your Win markers that appear near your energy bar in most fighting games.&nbsp; Clicking on the name allows you to space them farther apart or closer together.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Victory Mark Off</B> - If you wish to have a placeholder for your win marker when it hasn't appeared yet (sort of like the little white squares in Street Fighter Alpha 3), you can put them here.&nbsp; Otherwise, you can leave this blank.&nbsp; Once again, clicking on the name will allow you to space them farther apart or closer together.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Stage Layout 1-10</B> - These can be used for a bunch of things.&nbsp; Decorative borders around your life bars, super guages behind your round timer, etc.&nbsp; Or if you want anything else on screen, feel free to use one of these.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>1P/2P Life Gauge </B>- These skills are the graphics used for your characters' energy bars.&nbsp; You also set their positions in these two skills.&nbsp; Simply place them within the black square (representing the playfield) to where you'd like them to show on screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>1P/2P Special Gauge</B> - These skills are the graphics used for your characters' special stock guages. You set the position of these gauges in these skills as well.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Position: Timer</B> - This will allow you to set the position for your round timer.&nbsp; You cannot add graphics to this skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Pos: 1P/2P Face</B> - These skills let you set the position for your character portraits near your energy bars.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Pos: Victory Mark 1P/2P</B> - These two skills let you set the position for each player's win markers.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Pos: Special Stock 1P/2P</B> - These two skills let you set the position for your character special stock - <B>NOT</B> to be confused with special gauge.&nbsp; These are the numbers that show what super level you're at.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Title Cursor</B> - This is the graphic for your Mode Selection cursor on your title screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Position For the Story Mode</B> - This tells your game where to place the cursor when Story Mode is highlighted on the title screen.&nbsp; You cannot add a graphic to this skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Position For Versus Mode</B> - This tells your game where the cursor is placed when Versus Mode is Highlighted on the Title Screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Continue Cursor</B> - This is the cursor graphic used on your Game Over/Continue screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>The Cursor It Does </B>- This tells your game to position your continue cursor when "Yes" is highlighted on your continue screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>The Cursor It Does Not</B> - This tells your game where to position your continue cursor when "No" is highlighted on the continue screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>1P/2P Vs. Screen Cursor</B> - These skills are used as the character selection cursors for both players.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>1P/2P Vs. Cursor After Input</B> - These two skills are used to flash the character select cursors after you select a character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Pos: Cursor For Team Battle</B>&nbsp; - This tells the game where to place the cursor when "Team Mode" is highlighted on the Title Screen. (If you've included a Team mode in your game.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Pause</B> - This is the graphic shown on screen when you pause your game.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Spare 1-19</B> - These can be used much like the <B>Stage Layout</B> skills.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Phew! Quite a hefty list, huh...?&nbsp; Anyway, now that that's over, I'll go step by step to show you how to arrange your scripts for use on your playfield. (Note, this will only include Life bars, Stage Layouts, Super Guages, and Timers.)</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is just to show you how most of the scripts in this program are used.&nbsp; First, we're going to set up a few stage layouts to get an idea how we want our screen to look.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Open up your scripts section and scroll down to Stage Layout 1.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I'm going to open up a backdrop used for both player's energy bars and the round timer.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see, you simply upload it like a normal image.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After the image is uploaded, go to your editor window.&nbsp; You can position the image just as if you were aligning an animation frame for a character.&nbsp; Either click and drag, or edit the X, Y values of the image via the Image Properties utility at the side.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see by the black box, you can get a pretty good feel for where this border will appear on screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, we'll want to do the same thing with the borders for our characters' special gauges.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Upload these images the same way using as may Stage Layout scripts as you need (2 in my case), and position them within the black box to an area you're satisfied with.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Here's how it looks on my end.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now that we've got those set up, I want to show you what the point of this tedious exercise.&nbsp; Let's run a quick Test Play.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="bordertest.png" WIDTH="633" HEIGHT="427" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Wow! Pretty neat, huh?&nbsp; We're actually starting to look like a good ol' fashioned fighting game!&nbsp; These aesthetic appearances can really help out the look of your game, so take them into consideration when planning a project.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">We can't have all the decoration without the function though, so let's get all the important stuff in there, such as energy bars, the timer, special gauges and things like that.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">If you've already uploaded those images, you're ahead of the game, if not, simply upload them now.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">We're going to start with the round timer.&nbsp; Go to the skill entitled <B>Position: Timer</B>.&nbsp; Highlight the name of the skill.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">At the left you'll notice a setup utility similar to the others you've worked with -&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="timersettings.png" WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="134" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The <B>X</B> and <B>Y </B>values are the placement of the timer itself.&nbsp; This was fairly self explanatory, but what I want you to look at is -</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>SBL </B>- This is short for "Space Between Letters".&nbsp; This tells your game how far apart to place each digit in your timer.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I'm setting the SBL of my timer to <B>32</B>.&nbsp; This moves the numbers apart enough that they're only touching at the inside edge.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I've also set the position to <B>X +302</B>, <B>Y +20</B>.&nbsp; This centers the timer directly between both player's energy bars, but moves it slightly upward, to the center of the decorative frame.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="timerfinish.png" WIDTH="632" HEIGHT="90" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now we're getting somewhere.&nbsp; We're almost finished.&nbsp; Let's do the life and special guages at this point.&nbsp; Upload and position these graphics the same way you did with everything else, only this time place them in the skills called&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>1P Life Gauge</B>,<B> 2P Life Gauge</B>, <B>1P Special Gauge</B>, and <B>2P Special Gauge</B>.&nbsp; Line them up accordingly, and then let's take a look.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">(NOTE: Since we lined up our borders for these earlier, measuring where they should be placed is a whole lot easier.&nbsp; For player 1's life gauge, simply take the values you set for the borders and subtract 2 from the X value and subtract 2 from the Y value.&nbsp; For player 2's life gauge, take the values for the borders and add 2 to the X value and subtract 2 from the Y value.&nbsp; The special guages however, are a bit trickier unfortunately,&nbsp; You'll have to adjust those a few times until you get it right.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Let's see how these look.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="finishedguages.png" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Fantastic.&nbsp; This right here is technically functional, but we're going to want our characters portraits and a number showing how many super gauges they have stored as well.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Upload each of your <B>Number Special Stock</B> images as you need.&nbsp; You don't need to do all 9 levels if you don't plan on having 9 super levels.&nbsp; I'm sticking with 0 - 3.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="stocknumbers.png" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="84" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, you may not notice, but I had to adjust for spacing.&nbsp; Occasionally that happens, especially when you've got a very large graphic for your stock numbers.&nbsp; However, we're starting to look pretty good!!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">We're also going to need win marks.&nbsp; I'm going to use the Street Fighter Alpha 3 white placeholders for the Victory Mark Off, and a fist marker from the Marvel Vs. Capcom tileset for the Victory Marker On.&nbsp; The reason for this is, simply, that Marvel Vs. Capcom, being a cross-over battle title, has no win markers.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Placing these is similar to placing the timer, because it's got a value similar to the SBL value used for the timer. This time, there are two however.&nbsp; This allows you to edit the horizontal (Width) space, as well as the vertical (Height) space between your win markers.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="winmarkers.png" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="90" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Not bad if I do say so myself, but we're going to need a stage portrait too!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Go into your <B>Characters, SK</B> tab and go to the skill called <B>Stage Face Pic.</B> This is your character stage portrait.&nbsp; Simply upload an image here. (You can use a private palette if you don't want it to change color based on player palette.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After that, you can go back to your Scripts and go to the skills called <B>Pos: 1P Face</B> and <B>Pos: 2P Face</B>.&nbsp; Align these exactly the way you would any of your other scripts, and run a test play to see if you've done it correctly.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="finishedscript.png" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Hot damn, it looks like we're done!&nbsp; Almost looks like a bona fide arcade fighter!&nbsp; Sure, we're missing the character nameplate, but that's covered in Advanced Techniques.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Advanced Techniques - Variables Explained</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Here's something I know some people have trouble with.&nbsp; It's not really as hard as it seems, however.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, this section isn't a demonstration, as much as it is a definition of what variables are, and what they can do.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Variables are an incredibly useful tool.&nbsp; They're the most versatile thing in the world that Enterbrain chose to add to their program, and I'm a happier person for it!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Anyway, on to the explanation.&nbsp; Variables are just that... Variable.&nbsp; They are numerical values that can be altered at any time during a skill, and that variable can then be used to tell a skill to do something else.&nbsp; Variables come in three different flavors</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>System Variables</B> - These variables are system wide.&nbsp; They affect not only the player who activated them, but also anything else programmed to use that same system variable.&nbsp; These are typically used for instances involving whole stages (music changes when time's running out, music gets faster when health is low, etc.).&nbsp; These are not their only uses of course, they're only a few examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Character Variables</B> - Affect one character.&nbsp; They remain constant until one of that character's skills tells them to change.&nbsp; They do not affect anything involving the stage, or other characters.&nbsp; these are typically used for things like Transforming characters.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Task Variables</B> - It was my original belief that these affected only the skill they are present in.&nbsp; This is not the case.&nbsp; I have tested this theory.&nbsp; The difference between these variables and character variables is not a big one, but it is important if you want to use variables correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Task variables function like character variables on one character <U><B>OR</B></U> object, not both.&nbsp; For example, let's say you had a projectile that altered a character variable.&nbsp; This character variable can be accessed by any skill used by your character and still function properly.&nbsp; If you tried this with a task variable, the variable changed by the object would not affect the character at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">To place a variable in a skill, simply right click the square you wish to place it.&nbsp; The dropdown menu will appear as usual</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Scroll down to <B>Add &gt; Condition Fork</B>, and select <B>[V] Variable</B>. A square with a <B>V</B> will appear in your skill bar.&nbsp; Congratulations, you've added a variable condition to your skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">With the Variable square highlighted, at the left side of the editor window, you'll have your Variable Properties section.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="variableproperties.png" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="296" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The options you have here are:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Var - </B>This section allows you to pick a specific variable from the dropdown bar (Task Var A through P, Char Var A through P, and System Var A through P).&nbsp; You have a lot of variables to work with, and this is a good thing.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B># Calculate</B> <B>- </B>This section is where you edit the variable specifically.&nbsp; The numerical value is what you use to set the variable to a value you wish to use later.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>No Calculator</B> <B>-</B> This is the default setting.&nbsp; This means that no change to the variable's numerical value will occur, and you'll notice the number space is blacked out accordingly.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Replace -</B> This means that the numerical value the variable currently has set (default 0) will be replaced with whatever value placed here.&nbsp; (I.E. Char Variable B is currently 4.&nbsp; If you set a Replace condition with the numerical value as 1, the new value of the variable will change from 4 to the new setting of 1.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Add - </B>This will add any number (positive OR negative) you set in the value area to the current total of the variable.(I.E., Char Variable B is currently 4, if you set an Add condition with the value of 1, it will add 1 to the value, making the new variable value 5.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Use This - </B>When this box is checked, you can select a number of options from the dropdown bar below.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The dropdown bar has a number of options for you to use</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Task, Char, System Var A through P</B> <B>-</B> These settings allow you to use the current value of any variable on the list.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Data X/Y Coord -</B> These settings allow a variable to use the current X or Y coordinate of an object at the time the variable was accessed.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Data Map X/Y Coord - </B>These settings will allow a variable to use the number relative to the X or Y coordinate of an object relative to it's current place in a stage.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Parent X/Y Coord -</B> These settings allow an object's variable to use the number relative to the current X or Y coordinate of the parent object that created it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Data Time -</B> This allows a variable to use the current time as a numerical value.&nbsp; This can be used when you want the timer to activate certain conditions.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Data # of Rounds</B> <B>-</B> This allows a variable to use the number of the current round as a value.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now we move on to the important stuff.&nbsp; This is how to make a variable work.&nbsp; The Condition Branch section will read a value from a variable based on the options you've picked, and use the condition you set here to create a result.&nbsp; The functions of this section are as follows:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>No Cond Branch</B> <B>-</B> This means that there is no condition branch set.&nbsp; This is used when you want only to change a variable's value, but not have anything besides that occur.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>It's The Same -</B> This means that when the variable value is equal to the number specified in the Condition Branch section, the variable is found TRUE and will then go to the specified area in the skill as determined by the dropdown bar.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>It's Above -</B> This means that when the variable value is higher than the number specified in the Condition Branch section, the variable is found TRUE and will then go to the specified area in the skill as determined by the dropdown bar.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>It's Below -</B> This means that when the variable value is lower than the number specified in the Condition Branch section, the variable is found TRUE and will then go to the specified area in the skill as determined by the dropdown bar.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now I hate to say it, but even projectile attacks don't work as easily as they should.&nbsp; They pass through each other, nullify one, but not the other, and other horrid things like that.&nbsp; So here's something I came up with to solve that problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I drew the inspiration from Proof58's Akuma character.&nbsp; I was having problems creating a fireball that worked, so I looked through as many resources as I could find.&nbsp; Akuma had something that ALMOST worked.&nbsp; He had an extra attack frame below the ground that acted as collision for the projectile.&nbsp; This is how I fixed the method.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, create your projectile.&nbsp; The animation should include both the projectile and the destroy frames for the projectile</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="shotstart.png" WIDTH="517" HEIGHT="282" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="shotend.png" WIDTH="540" HEIGHT="315" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Put your move icon at the start, set the speed to whatever you need.&nbsp; I set mine to <B>+4.80</B>.&nbsp; This is just slightly faster than Rockman moves.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, what you want to do is put an <B>[SG] GoTo</B> condition that points back to the beginning of the skill in the frame before the destroyed animation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="shotgoto.png" WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="269" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Set up your attack frames as normal and set up your hit junctions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now for the strange part.&nbsp; You're going to create an attack frame just to the front of and WAAAAY below your projectile.&nbsp; Give it an M.Number of 1 so that it doesn't cancel out your actual attack frame.&nbsp; You're also going to need to give it an attack strength so that the effect will work later, otherwise projectiles will behave unpredictably.&nbsp; I give it the same strength as the actual attack just for ease.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="shotcolliderfa.png" WIDTH="527" HEIGHT="645" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, afterward, create a Defense frame at EXACTLY the same place as the attack frame you just made.&nbsp; Give it the <B>Doing</B> property.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="shotcolliderfd.png" WIDTH="526" HEIGHT="645" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Strange, I know, but it works!&nbsp; Now, create two DS boxes (Place these at the beginning of your animation).&nbsp; Set one of them to Attack Hits, and the other to Defending.&nbsp; You'll have them both point to the Destroyed part of your animation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="shotattackhits.png" WIDTH="537" HEIGHT="158" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="shotdefending.png" WIDTH="539" HEIGHT="155" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, you don't want the projectile to keep moving when it's destroyed, so place a move box at the beginning of the destroyed animation, set to Replace and all values at <B>0.00</B>.You may also have to set your DS pointers again, check those and correct them if necessary.&nbsp; It would also be a good idea to add an FD and FA box after the move box to neutralize the attack boxes around the actual projectile.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Last but not least, right click on the last box and select <B>Add &gt; End Skill</B>.&nbsp; This will end the destroyed skill and get rid of the object after it's destroyed.&nbsp; Add the projectile object to the necessary skill.&nbsp; Now, test it out.&nbsp; Have both characters fire at each other.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="shotscollide.png" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Worked like a charm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, there's a bit of a complicated method to get the character to be able to move around the screen&nbsp; but only be able to have one shot on screen at a time.&nbsp; It's REALLY unnecessary with most characters.&nbsp; The only two characters I can think that you could POSSIBLY use this technique with are Rockman and Cyclops because their Fierce punches are projectile attacks, and thus, require special circumstances to work properly.&nbsp; There's a MUCH easier method to do this with other characters that have command projectiles.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Advanced Techniques - Single On-Screen Projectile (Hard Type)</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Don't say I didn't warn you!! This caused me anguish for DAYS.&nbsp; But, wanting to bring as many techniques to the table as I can, I will explain to you in detail how I accomplished this feat.&nbsp; This is seriously a lot of effort for very little product, so use at your own risk!&nbsp; Also, this will be a LONG explanation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">(NOTE: This technique is fairly sloppy as it was put together in a cloud of frustration.&nbsp; I'm sure there's a neater way to do this.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">What this technique does is allow a character's shot animation to end, and let the character move as normal, but not be able to fire a second projectile until the first one collides with the enemy, another shot, or leaves the screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The reason I had to come up with this method in the first place is that the easier method didn't work for this character.&nbsp; This is likely a result of how Rockman's attack is set up (having to use variables to check whether he's standing, walking, what frame of walking, crouching, what have you).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, since Rockman's fierce punch is a projectile, there were a number of things I needed to do to make this work the way it does in Marvel Vs Capcom.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">When you press fierce punch, Rockman fires a buster shot.&nbsp; Yet if you press Fierce punch again&nbsp; He doesn't react at all, no animation changes.&nbsp; So what I had to do was set up a variable to determine what Rockman was doing.&nbsp; I used character variable M.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">M = 0 - Rockman is Stationary, either standing or crouching.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">M = 1-12 - Each individual frame of Rockman Walking forward.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">M = 13-24 - Each individual frame of Rockman Walking backward.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can probably guess, I had each animation change this value accordingly (the start of his crouching and standing animations set Variable M to 0, as do any of his jumping animations, while there's a variable change between each frame of his walking that sets them accordingly.)&nbsp; I also set a Detect Command input after each variable change to make sure that if you stopped pressing forward or backward, it would stop the walking animation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="standingvariable.png" WIDTH="345" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="backwardvariable.png" WIDTH="918" HEIGHT="29" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">So on and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I created a skill called "Shot Fail" which is what is used when Rockman is stationary and attempting to fire a second time.&nbsp; It's got a DB at the start set to Crouching, Formed, that points to the second part of the animation (which is Rockman crouching.)&nbsp; Both images in this frame have a wait time of <B>1</B>.&nbsp; The two M boxes make sure his movement stops if needed, and I placed an End skill at the end of each of them to tell the skill to stop when I need it to.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="shotfail.png" WIDTH="628" HEIGHT="266" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The FD objects in the animations are identical to what they would be if Rockman were standing or crouching.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I then created a skill called "Shot Variables" that holds each possible outcome for the Character Variable M and tells it where to point.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="shotvariables.png" WIDTH="624" HEIGHT="132" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, I had an object created during Rockman's shooting animations that set Character Variable P to 1, this was the variable that tells him not to be able to shoot more than one object at a time.&nbsp; I also added an End Skill followed by an [SC] Call Skill box that points to the Shot Variables frame.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="callshotvariables.png" WIDTH="589" HEIGHT="182" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">At the start of the animation I placed a variable check that says "If Variable P is more than zero, jump to SC - Shot Variables".&nbsp; I did this for both his crouching and standing versions of this attack.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">What this will do is cause Rockman not to be able to use his fierce punch while the shot is on the screen, because it will constantly call a shot failure.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This however is only half the battle.&nbsp; What we need to do now, is get the variable to reset itself when the object is no longer in play.&nbsp; This is what caused my torment.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, go to your projectile animation, at the beginning of the destroyed animation, place a Variable that resets Character Variable P to zero when the object is destroyed.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="variablepdestroy.png" WIDTH="572" HEIGHT="354" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, here's the complicated part.&nbsp; There is NO exact way to do this, as it all depends on the speed of your projectile.&nbsp; I placed a variable setup between each frame of the buster shot that sets Character Variable <B>C</B> to 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="variablecset.png" WIDTH="668" HEIGHT="361" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Once again, seems strange, yes, but it's VERY necessary.&nbsp; I then created an object called "Variable Object" which would then be used to deal with Character Variable C.&nbsp; I placed a blank image with a wait time of 3, followed by a variable edit.&nbsp; This variable edit would constantly subtract <B>1</B> from Character Variable C.&nbsp; I placed an SG after this to have the object keep looping and therefore keep adjusting the variable.&nbsp; After the SG, I created a two variable objects.&nbsp; The first one reset Character variable <U><B>P</B></U> to zero with a Condition fork stating that whenever Variable P equals 1 to jump back to the beginning of the skill to start the whole process over again.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="variableobject.png" WIDTH="412" HEIGHT="362" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, have this object created during your shot animation with an M.Number of 9 and a "Parent" property set so it will follow your character.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="variableobjectcreate.png" WIDTH="590" HEIGHT="345" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">What this object does is subtract from Variable C so that when the object is no longer on screen it'll tell each variable to reset as intended.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That's how it's done, and let's never speak of it again.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Advanced Techniques - Single On-Screen Projectile (Easy Type)</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is a far more merciful method to achieving a single on screen projectile.&nbsp; The problem is, it ONLY works with command based projectile characters (or characters who can just divert to a punch when a projectile is on screen.&nbsp; Rockman doesn't work that way due to the fact that his fierce punch does absolutely nothing when a projectile's on screen.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This will be demo'd using Ryu from my CAPCOM - Mini Melee game, as he's pretty much already done.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, create your animations as normal (I've already done this, as my game is a work-in-progress as of this writing).&nbsp; Now, if you've got all your objects set up as you want them (your projectile, really), we can get started.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, go to your object.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, at the start of the object add a variable condition that sets a character variable of your choice to <B>1</B> (I'm using variable <B>G</B>, as I've never used it in any other skills for this character).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="hadoukenvaluestart.png" WIDTH="651" HEIGHT="335" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, place one that cancels the variable at the beginning of your destroyed part of the animation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="hadoukenvalueend.png" WIDTH="669" HEIGHT="337" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You'll likely need to readjust your DS - Detect Skill conditions to point to the correct box once again, if so, do it now.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, go to the skill involving the object (in my case, Ryu's Hadouken (Weak) skill), and add in a variable condition at the very start.&nbsp; Set it to No Calculator, then set the condition branch to "It's The Same" as <B>+1</B>.&nbsp; Now, since This is a weak attack, I'll tell it to link to Ryu's Standing Jab skill, because that's the only possible outcome if the move doesn't activate (The reason for this is, the motion for the Hadouken ends in forward, so Ryu will be standing at the time it's completed).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="hadoukenweakfail.png" WIDTH="525" HEIGHT="343" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This will cause Ryu to jab as long as the Hadouken's on screen due to Character Variable G.&nbsp; Test the animation to see if it worked correctly.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="hadoukenweaktest.png" WIDTH="637" HEIGHT="333" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see, the Hadouken is in the frame, and Ryu is punching as a result.&nbsp; This is exactly what we want.&nbsp; This means that Ryu can act on his own but not be able to use the same move again until the fireball is gone.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That's about it.&nbsp; I must warn you though, this doesn't work 100% of the time.&nbsp; Sometimes the engine gets fussy and refuses to reset the variable when the projectile goes off screen.&nbsp; If this is the case with your project, there's two options.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">1.) See method </FONT><A HREF="#hs4011"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">(God help us all, lol).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">2.) This is how I typically handle it.&nbsp; You can make your projectile animations last a little bit longer than they would if this were actually Street Fighter.&nbsp; Ryu can't act until the animation is finished, but at least the original problem will not show up because there are no variables to mess with.&nbsp; Basically what I'm saying, is make the animation long enough to allow the projectile to leave the screen before you can use it again.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Advanced Techniques - Floating Nameplates</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I do have to admit, I'm probably not the first one to have come up with this technique.&nbsp; This however, is the method I figured out on my own while working on CAPCOM - Mini Melee.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, go into your character, and right below your "Stage Face Pic." skill, create a new skill called "Stage Name".&nbsp; This of course is up to you, but it'll help you keep things organized.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Upload your character's name (preferably using a private palette) into this skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="nameplate.png" WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="92" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, in the image properties utility check the "<B>Ignore the Direction</B>" checkbox.&nbsp; This will keep the name from flipping backward on the second player's side.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="ignoredirection.png" WIDTH="259" HEIGHT="71" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You can center the name on the white crosshair if you want, in fact, it's a decent idea because it'll help you place it better later on.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="nameplatecentered.png" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="91" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you've got that done, create a Goto Skill condition at the end of the skill that tells it to go back to "Stage Name 1".&nbsp; This will keep the name on screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="gotostagename.png" WIDTH="265" HEIGHT="160" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, go to your Stage Face Pic. skill and put an Object square at the beginning to create your nameplate.&nbsp; Select the Stage Name skill in the dropdown bar and give it the following properties.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Parent, Pic X,Y, and UnCond</B>.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This will create the object relative to the character portrait, so that the second player's portrait will place the name correctly as well.&nbsp; Pic X, Y will allow you to place the name relative to the stage, instead of to the portrait.&nbsp; and UnCond will keep the name from disappearing for any reason.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Align the name any way you see fit for your own personal taste.&nbsp; Sine mine's based off the Marvel Vs. Capcom script set, I'm going to hover the name over the character's life bars.&nbsp; I've also placed it with a depth of "Out", so that it would stand in front of the other scripts.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="namesettings.png" WIDTH="263" HEIGHT="278" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The last two things your going to do are set the wait time of the character's portrait image to it's maximum value of <B>65535</B>, thus making sure it doesn't keep creating name objects too quickly on each loop (thus lagging your game),&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="portraitsettings.png" WIDTH="365" HEIGHT="248" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">and next, you're going to add an SG &gt; Goto box at the end of the skill that tells it to loop back to "Stage Face Pic. <B>0</B>."&nbsp; This will keep the portrait looping so that the name can't disappear due unforseen circumstance.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="portraitsg.png" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="157" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now go into your game and test it out.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="nameplatefinished.png" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see, Rockman's name is hovering above his energy bar.&nbsp; Almost looks like a One on One version of Marvel Vs. Capcom, doesn't it?&nbsp; No? Ah, well.&nbsp; No matter.&nbsp; That's the trick!&nbsp; Hope you found it useful!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">On a side note, if you don't plan on having stage portraits (i.e. Street Fighter II) don't even bother with this trick.&nbsp; Simply place the name in the Stage Face Pic. slot and go from there!</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Advanced Techniques - Creating Super Combos </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Super combos... Where would today's fighting games be without them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> First, a little history lesson...&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">(Skip it if you want to, but I feel like it's necessary to explore the roots of certain game related trivia.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Most people would say Capcom started this trend with Super Street Fighter II Turbo, this is not the case however.&nbsp; SNK Actually did it first.&nbsp; Capcom released SSFII Turbo in 1994 on it's CPS2 hardware, but two years before, in 1992, the Neo</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">·</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Geo housed a game known as Art of Fighting.&nbsp; This game was SNK's answer to the popularity of the numerous iterations of the Street Fighter II game, and SNK was in fact, targeting Street Fighter's Ryu in it's main character of Ryo Sakazaki.&nbsp; Capcom of course, retaliated in kind by creating Dan Hibiki a few years later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">In Art of Fighting, you could use a technique called a Super Death Blow which drained your character's stamina bar, which made your attacks fairly useless until you recharged your stamina.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Anyway, where SNK paved the way, Capcom later perfected.&nbsp; With the release of the Street Fighter Alpha series of games, came a revamped and much more varied Super Combo system (Super Combo was the name given to these techniques by Capcom).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Capcom introduced a system that no longer required a stamina bar, meaning your special moves still worked as intended, and the super gauge was multi-level.&nbsp; You could store up to 3 at a time, and then release them using either 1, 2 or all 3 levels of your super gauge.&nbsp; This allowed for a level of strategy, go with a weaker Super Combo, but save some for later, or blow it all in an all or nothing strike.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The system used by Fighter Maker is technically that of Street Fighter Alpha, though if you wish, you can tweak it to be much like Art of Fighting if you wanted to.&nbsp; However, since what most people think of for super attacks is that of King of Fighters or Street Fighter Alpha, that's what we're sticking to.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Here's how it's done.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, create your super attack animation. I've already done this, as I compiled Son Gokuu to be able to transform, so I needed each of his animations completed.&nbsp; I will demonstrate using Gokuu's famous Kamehameha.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="kamehamehastart.png" WIDTH="613" HEIGHT="278" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see, the animation is pretty much complete.&nbsp; I've got my transformation variables, objects, special effects, what have you.&nbsp; This is not yet a super combo however.&nbsp; Creating these attacks is possible in one step.&nbsp; At the beginning of the Super Combo animation right click and select <B>Add &gt; Gauge - [GS] Check Special Gauges Fork</B>. Of course, once again, at the left side of the editor, you will see the properties editor.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="specialguagecheckproperties.png" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="201" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">In the <B>Setting </B>section, we have</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Special Gauge 'X' From -</B> This basically means Current Special Gauge level.&nbsp; The number is used to determine how much special gauge you have stored.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>When Little</B> <B>-</B> Should more accurately be translated as "If Below", meaning that with this option selected, if your special stock is BELOW the number specified in "Special Gauge from", the skill will continue.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>When Alot -</B> Is also more accurately translated as "If Above", meaning that with this option selected, if your special stock is ABOVE the number specified above, the skill will continue normally.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Add To Advance - </B>This allows you to place a number to add (positive number) or subtract (negative number) in order to advance the skill as intended.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>If It Failed - </B>This is used when the conditions you have set have not been met (for example "Special Gauge 2 from When Alot, meaning when gauge is over two levels, if you try to use the move with one level) the skill triggered instead is placed in this space.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, Here's how to create a level 1 super combo.&nbsp; In "Special Gauge from" leave the number as zero, then select the option "When Alot".&nbsp; This tells the game that this skill will only work when the character's gauge is above zero, meaning one level or higher.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After this, place <B>-1</B> in "Add to Advance".&nbsp; This will subtract one level from your super gauge when you use this skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now finally, in "If it failed" you can place any animation you wish.&nbsp; Since Son Gokuu's super combos are both done with heavy punch, I'll tell it to go to his standing strong punch if the gauge is too low.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="specialguagecheckcomplete1.png" WIDTH="255" HEIGHT="205" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">And that's it.&nbsp; Test Play your game and try it out.&nbsp; If done correctly, it should behave as such.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, you'll notice Son Gokuu has 3 levels stored.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="gokuusuperguagemax.png" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">But, now, I'll use the Kamehameha.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="gokuusupercombo1.png" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, not only did player two take a nasty hit, but if you'll take a look at the bottom left corner, Son Gokuu's super gauge level has decreased.&nbsp; This is exactly what we're looking for.&nbsp; Also, after his super gauge is depleted completely, the command will cause him to punch instead of firing a beam.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">And that would be that.&nbsp; You can change the values to allow for second and third level supers as well.&nbsp; Just use these settings instead of the ones demonstrated before.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>2nd Level Super Combo -</B> Special Gauge 1 from, When Alot, -2 Add to Advance</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>3rd Level Super Combo -</B> Special Gauge 2 from, When Alot, -3 Add to Advance.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Simple, huh?&nbsp; The skies the limit as far as levels.&nbsp; You could make a super attack that takes 9 bars to use, but in most cases, the fight would be over long before it saw the light of day.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Enjoy!</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Advanced Techniques - Creating Transforming Characters </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Transforming characters.&nbsp; Generally these are the characters with the most potential to be cool or memorable in your fighting games.&nbsp; The reason for this is that transforming is a gimmick.&nbsp; When you see a character change into something else mid-fight, it sticks in your head.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I remember back in the FM95 days that this was a bitch and a half to pull off... Not so much anymore since the introduction of variables!&nbsp; They've made thing 100% easier.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, the first thing you need when creating a transforming character is the base character itself.&nbsp; Since Dragonball Z has ready access to characters who can transform, I will be using Son Gokuu from Dragonball Z - Super Butouden on the Super Famicom.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="gokuustand.png" WIDTH="251" HEIGHT="204" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Sure, not the greatest LOOKING choice of the three Super Famicom DBZ games, but it already had the resources I needed to make this process go faster.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, you're going to need to get all your animations set up as you would for a regular character.&nbsp; This includes standing, movement, crouching, attacks, hit junctions, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After that, it's time to get creative.&nbsp; Create a skill that's used specifically for the transformation sequence. (I would normally make this skill a 3rd level super combo, so it's not overpowering).&nbsp; Considering I'm using Son Gokuu, I'll call it "Super Saiyajin Transformation".</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Compile your animation and any special effects you want it to have, and then at the end, have it control one of your character variables. (I used Character Variable P).&nbsp; Have it set this variable to whatever you wish, though more than on+1 is usually overkill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="supersaiyajin.png" WIDTH="540" HEIGHT="338" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I had also set a variable condition at the beginning to be sure that when the move is used while transformed nothing will happen.&nbsp; I'll go into that more in a bit.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you've set this skill up, you basically need to go back and alter all your other animations.&nbsp; What I mean by this is you need to create your character's transformed animations.&nbsp; So what you're basically doing is creating two characters in one.&nbsp; Here's the altered standing animation so you can see what I mean.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="ssjstand.png" WIDTH="405" HEIGHT="253" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Basically, what I did was duplicate the original animation at the end of the original using new frames.&nbsp; I separated the original and transformed animations with an <B>End Skill</B> condition at the end of the normal version animation/beginning of the transformed animation (dead center in the skill) so that the animations wouldn't both cycle.&nbsp; Now, at the very beginning, I placed a Variable condition at the beginning to check whether or not the transformation variable has been activated.</FONT><BR>
<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see, the condition says "When Character Variable P is above 0 Goto Standing 5".&nbsp; This tells the animation to skip straight to the Super Saiyajin standing instead of his normal standing whenever the variable is above zero.&nbsp; Now, simply repeat this process with every animation in your character as well as setting variable conditions at the start to point to the correct areas of the animations.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">On another note, this same technique can be used to create a revert to normal animation.&nbsp; Simply have a variable at the beginning of the transformation skill point to a revert animation if the character variable is above zero.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That's pretty much it for transforming characters.&nbsp; The beauty of the fact that you need to replicate each animation is that you also replicate the Attack Frames too, so you can actually make the transformed versions have stronger attacks than their normal forms!</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Advanced Techniques - Creating a Custom Combo Counter </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Alright, I know every user of this program who sees how the combo numbers work are disappointed with it.&nbsp; I was as well.&nbsp; The thought running through your mind was probably the same as mine, "That just looks stupid".&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Well, after much advice, help-seeking, experimentation and tweaking, I'm able to tell you how to program a combo counter that CAPCOM would be proud of.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">(NOTE: I would like to take this time to thank Proof58 and Acid for their input on this.&nbsp; It has helped me tremendously and was the finishing step I needed to complete this tutorial.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, there are actually a couple of ways to do this, and some are easier than others.&nbsp; Mine is a little on the harder side as I've added a few extra steps that will save you work in the long run.&nbsp; I will make a note of the other ways that are typically used at various places in my explanation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I'll be showcasing this technique using screenshots from my CAPCOM - Mini Melee project, so this will simultaneously allow me to work on this tutorial and my game.&nbsp; Anyway, let's get started.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Open up your project and select a character and go to their <B>Stage Face Pic</B> skill.&nbsp; I'll use Ryu, since he's got a lot of combo oriented moves.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="ryustageface.png" WIDTH="533" HEIGHT="187" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, the first thing you need to do is add a Variable to your skill.&nbsp; Right Click on the first square in your skill and select <B>Add &gt; Condition Fork - [V] Variable</B>.&nbsp; A box with a V in it should show up.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="ryufaceemptyvar.png" WIDTH="422" HEIGHT="366" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You'll also notice the Variable Properties section.&nbsp; We're going to need to change some settings here.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Firstly, you'll need to set the <B>Var.</B> to a <B>Character Variable</B> instead of a Task variable.&nbsp; I've use a pretty good amount of Character variables for Ryu already, so I'll have to hunt for one to use.&nbsp; I have <B>Character Variable C</B> available to me, so I'll set it to this.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You're going to click <B>Replace</B> and then the <B>Use This</B> checkbox.&nbsp; Set the dropdown bar next to the checkbox to <B>Data: X coor</B>.&nbsp; This will set the System Variable to the X coordinate of the character portrait.&nbsp; This is <B>VERY </B>important, do not skip this step.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="ryufacesetvar.png" WIDTH="411" HEIGHT="364" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This will allow you to check which player activated the system variable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, after this, you're going to head to your Hitsparks.&nbsp; There's a couple ways of handling this.&nbsp; You can either make one hitspark object that loads all your animations up (which is how I usually see it done, since it makes configuring hit junctions much simpler) or you can use multiple hitspark objects (which is the way I'll be doing it since I already configured the hitsparks, if you're doing it this way as well, you'll need to duplicate each one of your hitsparks to be used by player 2, just add - P2 at the end of the duplicate's skill name).&nbsp; It's your choice, they both take a pretty similar amount of work.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">For the first player's hitsparks, you're going to add a variable check at the beginning of the animation much like you did with the character portrait.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, Set the Variable to Character Variable C again, only this time, you'll use the Condition Branch section for the rest of your settings.&nbsp; Click <B>It's Above</B>, and set it to <B>+300</B>.&nbsp; This will check to see what the initial variable was set to by each of the portraits.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason the character variable was important was to allow the actual game to differentiate between characters, because if you were to use a system variable, both characters would end up changing one variable and the whole setup wouldn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Set the destination of the variable check to the second player's variation of your hitspark (in my case, this is "Light Physical Spark - P2").&nbsp; When you're finished it should look something like this:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="p2hitspark.png" WIDTH="435" HEIGHT="363" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now we'll need to set up some way to count our hits.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Creating a Combo Counter Continued&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Alright, to make a combo counter, we're going to need numbers.&nbsp; There are a few ways to set up your numbers in regards to your game.&nbsp; You can put them in a skill somewhere on your character, or you can program them into a script.&nbsp; Since I find programming it into the script much more time saving, that's what I'm doing.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Most of the time, the combo counter is all on one skill with the frames numbering in the hundreds... I found this a bit cumbersome.&nbsp; It works, but not as efficiently as I'd like.&nbsp; So here's what I'm doing.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I'll be creating the following skills.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>P1 - One's Digit</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>P1 - Ten's Digit</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>P1 - 'Hit' Image</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>P2 - One's Digit</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>P2 - Ten's Digit</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>P2 - 'Hit' Image</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">They're all pretty obvious.&nbsp; This way instead of having to make a single skill with numbers 2 - 99 hits, I'll only need to use 0 - 9 at any given time.&nbsp; I find this much less of a hassle.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Simply add your images as necessary (0 - 9 in the one's place, leave the Ten's place blank for now, and add your "Hit/Hits" word to the 'Hit' Image skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After you do that, go to one of your empty stage layout skills.&nbsp; (I'm using Stage Layout 2 for player 1 and Stage Layout 3 for player 2).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I'm adding 3 objects (first one is for 10's Place number, second is for 1's place number, and the third is for the Hit word) followed by a blank image, and a script movement that points back to said blank image.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="stagelayout2.png" WIDTH="345" HEIGHT="215" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This skill will act as a dummy object holding a place for the numbers to appear while still being invisible.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Feel free to use an image that'll show up in your editor so you can get a good idea of the screen layout and can set your objects as necessary.&nbsp; I set mine to these coordinates in Player 1's setup</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Ten's Place - X +10 Y +124</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">One's Place - X +70 Y +124</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">'Hit' Image - X +130 Y +134</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This may take some tweaking on your end as the coordinates used are determined by the size of the numbers you're using as well as where you would like them on screen.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, we need to go back to our character so we can make these numbers actually appear as well as increase.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Go to your hitsparks.&nbsp; You'll add a Variable condition fork right before the animation begins.&nbsp; This variable will control how many hits register on the combo counter.&nbsp; You'll need system variables for this.&nbsp; I haven't used any besides System Variable P in this game, so I'll set it to System Variable A for Player 1, and System Variable C for Player 2.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Have this variable add +1 to the player's respective System Variable.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="hitsparkvar1.png" WIDTH="432" HEIGHT="351" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This controls the one's place digit.&nbsp; Now we're going to want some way to display the ten's place digit as well.&nbsp; So here's how I set it up.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">At the end of the skill place an <B>End Skill</B> condition.&nbsp; After this condition, place two <B>Variable </B>conditions followed by another <B>End Skill</B>.&nbsp; Now go back to your original variable that added +1 to System Variable A.&nbsp; In the condition branch select <B>It's Above</B> and set it to <B>+9</B>.&nbsp; Have this branch point to the first Variable condition after the first end skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="hitsparkvar2.png" WIDTH="440" HEIGHT="347" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, set the variable you just pointed to to System Variable <B>B</B> for player 1 and <B>D</B> for player 2 respectively.&nbsp; Tell it to <B>add</B> <B>+1</B> to the variable.&nbsp; Now, in the second variable, tell it to reset System Variable A (or C) back to zero.&nbsp; This way every time it cycles to 10, it will reset back to zero and add one to the ten's place variable.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">After this, copy the hit spark animation, and paste it after the variables that you put after the End Skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="hitsparkvar3.png" WIDTH="530" HEIGHT="364" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This will make sure the hit spark's animation plays when the new system variable is set.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Simply apply this technique to all your hit sparks.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now that our groundwork is set, we need to make the numbers actually appear on screen, so we've got to do some variable work.&nbsp; Go back to your <B>P1 One's Digit</B> skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Add a blank image at the start of the skill, and between your zero and one digit.&nbsp; Then place an <B>[SG] GoTo</B> between each image in your skill.&nbsp; It should look like this:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="combosg.png" WIDTH="610" HEIGHT="260" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Set each of these to point back to the start of the skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, add a <B>[V] Variable</B> between each of the frames except for the frame housing your 'Zero' number and your 'One' number.&nbsp; It'll look like this when you're finished:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="combov.png" WIDTH="764" HEIGHT="295" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, set the variables to Var. <B>System Var:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A</B>,<B> </B>No Calculation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, set them to "It's Above", and tell them to point to the next <B>'V'</B> that comes after it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">So if you've followed correctly they should point this way:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">1 to <B>6</B>, 6 to <B>11</B>, 11 to <B>14</B>, 14 to <B>17</B>, 17 to <B>20</B>, 20 to <B>23</B>, 23 to <B>26</B>, 26 to <B>29</B>, and 29 to <B>32</B>.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="combovpoint.png" WIDTH="770" HEIGHT="368" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, as for the Variable at 32, have it point to the SG at the end of the skill.&nbsp; This will start the cycle over again.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now for the tricky part.&nbsp; You need to set it so the counter will read your hitsparks.&nbsp; This is done in the variables you just placed.&nbsp; You'll need to set the "It's Above" number to correspond to the variable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Set the variables this way:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Frame 1 = <B>+0</B>, Frame 6 = <B>+1</B>, Frame 11 = <B>+2</B>, Frame 14 = <B>+3</B>, Frame 17 = <B>+4</B>, Frame 20 = <B>+5</B>,&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Frame 23 = <B>+6</B>, Frame 26 = <B>+7</B>, Frame 29 = <B>+8</B>, and Frame 32 = <B>+9</B>.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="combo+9.png" WIDTH="766" HEIGHT="365" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">If you've done this correctly, you should have a combo counter that counts up to the number 9.&nbsp; Try it out, and if the digits don't show up, review and correct.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="5hits.png" WIDTH="638" HEIGHT="479" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see, Ryu's Shinkuu Hadouken hit 5 times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now we'll need to have the 10's digits appear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Custom Combo Counter - Ten's Place and 'Hits' <HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Here's what you do to set up numbers higher than nine.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Go to your <B>P1 - Ten's Digit</B> skill.&nbsp; Place a blank image at the start, and then images with the numbers 1 - 9 after that.&nbsp; You should have 10 frames.&nbsp; Now, place a <B>[SG] GoTo</B> between each of the frames once again, and also once again pointing to the start of the skill (in this case, P1 - Ten's Digit 0).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, we need to place a <B>[V]</B> <B>Variable</B> at the start of the skill, and between every image, like so:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="p1tenssetup.png" WIDTH="705" HEIGHT="80" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Set each of the variables to Var. <B>System Var:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B</B>, no calculation, It's Above (very much like in the one's place).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Once again, you'll have each of them point to the next one after them in the line (Frame 1 to 4, 4 to 7, etc.), and set each number accordingly once again set each variable's 'It's Above' condition to the correct number</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">(Frame 1 = +0, Frame 4 = +1, Frame 7 = +2, etc, all the way up to frame 28 = +9).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="p1tens+9.png" WIDTH="703" HEIGHT="347" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This sets up the 10's digits to show up when called for.&nbsp; Now we should have 10's digits that show up when necessary.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">However, we need to tweak one more thing in our <B>P1 One's Digit</B> skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Add a <B>[V] Variable</B> condition in frame 2 and 8 in the one's digit skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Set these variables to Var: <B>System Var:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B</B>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Calculation, It's Above.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="combonewvariables.png" WIDTH="798" HEIGHT="371" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Tell the variable in frame 2 to point to the image in frame 5 (the image should be a number zero), and the variable in frame 8 to point to frame 11 (the image should be a number one).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="comboimage1.png" WIDTH="802" HEIGHT="368" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, check your variables and GoTo conditions in your skill, as adding these new variables may have moved their pointers.&nbsp; Fix them if necessary.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, load your test play and hit your opponent until the number 10 or higher appears.&nbsp; If it worked, you followed correctly.&nbsp; If it didn't, check back and see what happened.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="goesto11.png" WIDTH="639" HEIGHT="478" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">As you can see, this one goes to 11.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now we want to make the "Hits" word appear.&nbsp; Simply copy the technique you used in your <B>P1 - One's Digit</B> skill, except replace all the images that have numbers with your 'hits' word image.&nbsp; Set your variables and SG's accordingly.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="hitssetup.png" WIDTH="805" HEIGHT="355" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Since you're just copying the technique we employed earlier in the one's place, your skill should work fine if you've done your work right.&nbsp; Open up your test play and try it out.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="15hitssuccess.png" WIDTH="639" HEIGHT="479" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Success!&nbsp; We've got a combo counter for player 1!&nbsp; Now, simply copy each of these to the P2 skills, and set everything that says Variable A to Variable C, and everything that says Variable B to Variable D.&nbsp; This will make Player 2's hits add to a separate counter than the first player's.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now we need to make the combo numbers disappear.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Advanced Techniques - Combo Counter Reset </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, we'll need to set up a way to get the combo counter to reset, or else we'd just have hit numbers continually increasing the entire match.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">This is most often done by setting up various actions in the character's hit junctions.&nbsp; This is how I will do it as well.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, we'll determine how to make the numbers disappear if a combo has not been continued in a sufficient amount of time.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, you'll want to create a skill called <B>Combo Reset P1 </B>to be used to reset player 1's combo counter.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">There's not too much to do here for a basic counter, really.&nbsp; All you need to do here is place two <B>[V]</B> events to tell your System variables (P1 = A and B, P2 = C and D) to reset.&nbsp; Then, at the end of each of your hit junctions/block skills, place an <B>[SC]</B>&nbsp; - <B>Call Skill</B> that points to your combo reset.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="comboresetp1.png" WIDTH="294" HEIGHT="158" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Not a big deal really.&nbsp; Now, we'll move on to getting Player 2's combo to reset as well.&nbsp; Simply place a variable condition at the start of Combo Reset P1 to check and see if the second player activated the condition instead of player 1.&nbsp; Tell it to go to <B>Combo Reset P2</B> (If you haven't created this skill, do so now).&nbsp; Just set up a condition to reset both of your second player's combo System Variables this time.&nbsp; I ended up using a condition saying "If System Variable C is above 1 jump to Combo Reset P2" because for some reason the character Variable C didn't work.&nbsp; Play with it a bit, you'll get it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Note:</B> You're going to want the end of your hit animations to last long enough not to end the combo count prematurely... just add a little extra length to the last frame of your animation if you're not sure.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">That's pretty much it for your basic combo counter.&nbsp; Not too bad, wouldn't you say?&nbsp; There are a few extra tweaks to them, but I haven't quite gotten the technique down for it yet, so it will likely be included in the next update to this document.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>Advanced Techniques - Creating Continuing Stage Music</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">A big thanks goes to Acid over at </FONT><A HREF="http://www.fmhq.us"><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="3">FMHQ</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> for this one.&nbsp; It's not that difficult either!&nbsp; In fact, it only requires the use of one variable!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">First, open up the stage you wish to set the BGM for.&nbsp; Go to a layer that remains fairly constant (the floor, the sky, what have you.&nbsp; I'm using the far smokestacks layer for mine.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Right click the very first Image of your skill and select <B>Add &gt; Condition Fork - [V] Variable</B>.&nbsp; This will place a variable square at the beginning of your animation, like so -&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="stagevariable.png" WIDTH="312" HEIGHT="36" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, right click the second square and select <B>Add &gt; Sound</B>.&nbsp; This will place a Sound square in the second square of your skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Firstly, upload a blank .wav file (I've called this "Null Sound.wav").&nbsp; At this point, go into your "Basic" tab for your stage, and set this as the music for your stage.&nbsp; This will keep your music from going silent on the second round of combat.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="nullsound.png" WIDTH="258" HEIGHT="111" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, upload your music (In my case, Rockman's Theme (Looping).wav) into your Sound setup and right underneath the dropdown bar, check the "Loop To Point" checkbox.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="musicsetup.png" WIDTH="316" HEIGHT="306" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now back to that variable.&nbsp; You can use any variable you like, but I like Task variables because they don't interfere with your system variables or your character variables in any way.&nbsp; I'm leaving it at the default of Task Variable: A.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, click Replace, and check the "Use This" checkbox.&nbsp; In the dropdown bar below Use This, select <B>Data: # of Rounds </B>(This should be the last option in the dropdown bar).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="taskvariableset.png" WIDTH="265" HEIGHT="158" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">In the <B>Condition Branch</B> section, click on "It's above" and set the numerical value to <B>+1</B>.&nbsp; Set the Dropdown bar to the layer you're working on, and the image AFTER the Sound box. (In my case, this is "Smokestacks (Horizon) 3").</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="condbranch.png" WIDTH="262" HEIGHT="130" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, to finish up, we want to set a condition that doesn't let the stage layer play the sound the second time the stage is loaded up, so at the end of your skill, right click and select <B>Add &gt; Script Movement - [SG] Goto Skill</B>.&nbsp; An SG box will appear at the end of your skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="sgstagebox.png" WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="53" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, just set this to go back to the image right after the sound clip (once again, in my case "Smokestacks (Horizon) 3").&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="goto.png" WIDTH="264" HEIGHT="106" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">And that should be that!&nbsp; Run your stage and complete a round.&nbsp; The music should now continue through the rounds instead of starting over!&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, there is a little trick I came up with as a modification to this technique that I used for this stage specifically.&nbsp; If you've played Marvel Vs. Capcom, you may remember there's a small opening drum riff at the beginning of Rockman's stage music that never plays again throughout the song.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">To accomplish this, simply upload your sound clip (Rockman's Theme (Drum).wav in my case) to the square right after your initial variable.&nbsp; Do not give it any special properties such as "Loop to Point", this would ruin the effect.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="specialsoundtrick.png" WIDTH="352" HEIGHT="301" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Afterward, simply place an image (usually a duplicate of the image that makes up the layer) after the opening sound.&nbsp; You can then use this image to time when you want the actual music to start in.&nbsp; I set the Wait time on my image to <B>168</B>, which times perfectly with the drum riff leading into the main music.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="specialsoundimage.png" WIDTH="365" HEIGHT="233" BORDER="0"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Just play around with the wait time until you get the spacing correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">NOTE: Make sure your Variable and your Goto condition are&nbsp; still pointing to the image after the stage music sound!&nbsp; If this is not the case they can ruin your setup!</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">You can use this trick when creating any number of stages from the King of Fighters series, as they use this trick a LOT (just listen to 'Esaka' Team Japan's theme, or 'Still Green' Shingo Yabuki's Theme.&nbsp; They both have cutoff musical intros at the start of the song that never loops again.)&nbsp; But I'm sure there are still other things you might think to use this for in your project as well... we can but hope, anyway!</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">There are a lot of tabs in Fightermaker 2nd.&nbsp; They're not entirely difficult, but many tabs use the same names, so this document and other documents/forum posts can get slightly confusing.&nbsp; What this section is for is to show you what all the Program Tabs and various Icons throughout the program look like and how they are used/what they do.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The format will have the name of the tab or icon in <B>bold</B> print and the definition in standard.&nbsp; If it is a subcategory of a tab however, the original category tab will be placed next to it in <I>italicized</I> font encircled by parenthesis.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">We'll start out with the program tabs.</FONT><BR>
<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">_________________________________</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Game System - </B>This tab is where you set up various aspects of your game, Basic settings, scripts, the master hit junctions list and common images, as well as settings for your character select screens will be found here.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Basic</B> (<I>Game System</I>) <B>- </B>This tab allows you to set up basic functionality for your game.&nbsp; Pause time after collisions, your demos, what kind of modes your game will have available, whether or not to use the "offset" function, etc.&nbsp; Not to be confused with teh Characters basic tab.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Basic Script </B>(<I>Game System</I>)<B> - </B>This tab is where you set up all your scripts for your game.&nbsp; Lifebars, timer numbers, win markers, round animations, various decorations for your screen, it's all here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Hit Junctions</B> (<I>Game System</I>)<B> -&nbsp;</B> This tab is the master hit junctions list.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where you set up the initial hit junctions that your game will use.&nbsp; This is not to be confused with the Character hit junctions tab, described further down.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Common Images </B>(<I>Game System</I>)<B> - </B>This tab is the master common images list.&nbsp; Similar to the hit junctions list, this is where you set up the initial common images your game will use.&nbsp; Once again, this is not to be confused with the Character common images tab.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Char. Selection Picture </B>(<I>Game System</I>)<B> - </B>This tab is more accurately described as Character Select Setup.&nbsp; What this tab allows you to do is set the starting position for the two cursors, the number of rows and columns, the number of characters, and the space between each portrait on the character select screen.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">_________________________________</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Characters - </B>This tab allows you to access various options for characters in your fighting game.&nbsp; This is where you edit their animations, their skills, their collisions, their hit junctions, as well as attack inputs and artificial intelligence.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Basic </B>(<I>Characters</I>) <B>-</B> This tab allows you to enter basic data about your character.&nbsp; Some of it is merely aesthetic, like age and gender, but others are for function, such as whether or not the character is useable in certain game modes, how much energy they have, special stock, etc.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>SK </B>(<I>Characters</I>) <B>-</B> This tab is where your characters animations, also called "Skills" are edited.&nbsp; It is here that you set animation frames, framespeed, as well as collision detection/reactions.&nbsp; This is the focal point of character creation.&nbsp; You'll spend most of your time in this editor.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Hit Junction </B>(<I>Characters</I>) <B>-</B> This tab is where you assign animations to the hit junctions created in the master list.&nbsp; It's a simple set of dropdown bars associated to your various hit junctions.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Common Images </B>(<I>Characters</I>) <B>-</B> Similar to the Hit Junction tab, this is where you assign frames to each of the common images in your game's master list.&nbsp; The difference is however, that this is treated much more like skill creation in that you have the frame displayed in an editor window, and that frame can be changed via numbers at the top, and positioned anywhere in the field.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Commands </B>(<I>Characters</I>) <B>-</B> This is where you place the control input commands for your characters attacks.&nbsp; The area at the right side allows you to assign animations to character situations, and the area below it allows you to set the command.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>CPU </B>(<I>Characters</I>) <B>-</B> This tab is where you set up your characters' artificial intelligence.&nbsp; It can be a bit daunting at first, but when you get the hang of it, it's no big deal.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Story Mode </B>(<I>Characters</I>) <B>-</B> This tab lets you set up your "Story Mode".&nbsp; You set up fights, in between demos, special circumstances for secret fights, endings, etc.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">_________________________________</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Stages - </B>This tab is where you edit your game's stages.&nbsp; This is handled much like character creation, though there are far less sections to worry about.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Basic </B>(<I>Stages</I>) <B>-</B> This tab lets you set up the music for your stage.&nbsp; That's all.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Script.</B> (<I>Stages</I>) <B>-</B> This tab is where you design your actual stages.&nbsp; This is a lot like the skill editor in Characters, but this time each skill layer acts as a stage layer, with those farthest at the top being the farthest back, and the bottom of the list being the closest.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Demos - </B>This is the tab that lets you edit various cutscenes and other more functionally adapted demos such as character select and continue screens.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Basic </B>(<I>Demos</I>) <B>-</B> Pretty much identical to the Stages Basic tab.&nbsp; This tab allows you to edit the music for the demo (whee!), set how long the demo actually is, and whether or not it can be skipped with a button press.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Script. </B>(<I>Demos</I>) <B>-</B> Once again, this is pretty much just like the Stages tab of the same name.&nbsp; You design your demos here much the same way you edited your stages with the same layering rules applying.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">_________________________________</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now, we need to take a look at the icons in the game.&nbsp; These only show up in the various editors of the program, meaning Basic Script, Stages, Demos, and Characters.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">These have already been discussed in various sections of the document, but they will be placed here to cut down on browsing time.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Image Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="ibox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This icon represents an image in a skill or animation.&nbsp; You'll see a lot of these while creating a game.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Motion Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="mbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This box is used when you want to set motion parameters for a skill.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Object Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="obox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This box allows you to create an object in an animation using a skill from the character's list.&nbsp; This is typically used to create projectile attacks or special effects.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Sound Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="sbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This box is used to play a sound during an animation.&nbsp; This sound can be a .WAV file, a .MID file, or a CDDA Audio track (the track played depends on the current CD inserted in the drive).</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Frame - Attack Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="fabox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This box allows you to place a collision detection square for an attack within a frame of animation.&nbsp; You can set the damage of the attack with this as well.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Frame - Defense Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="fdbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This box allows you to place a collision detection square used for detecting if an attack lands within a frame of animation.&nbsp; You set the collision properties type here as well.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Reaction Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This is used for hit junctions.&nbsp; You assign a hit junction to each dropdown field in the reaction box to tell a character how to react when hit by this attack.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; If the Power setting in your Attack Frame is zero, the hit junctions will not respond correctly, if at all.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Detect Skill Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="dsbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This is a bit of an odd one.&nbsp; This is used to detect various conditions within a skill, such as whether or not an attack lands, if the character is landing from a fall or jump, defending, etc.&nbsp; Using these conditions you can tell a skill to divert to another skill or a different part of a skill depending on what happened.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Cancel Condition Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="cbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This is used to make a skill cancelable.&nbsp; You can set various conditions that can let you stop a skill mid animation to divert to another skill.&nbsp; This is useful in creating string combo systems such as the "Magic Series" combos from the Capcom Vs. games, or Post-MK3 Mortal Kombat titles.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Basic Divergence Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="dbbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This is another odd one.&nbsp; It's very similar to the Detect Skill box, except that it uses even more broad spectrum detection methods.&nbsp; Instead of using a condition that is happening to a character, the Basic Divergence box uses conditions such as whether specific directions have been pressed, a character is standing, crouching, etc.&nbsp; This can also be used as a branch.&nbsp; If a condition isn't met, you can have something happen as well as if a condition is met.&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Variable Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="vbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This is by far my favorite and arguably the most useful new function introduced in Fightermaker 2nd.&nbsp; What this does is allow you to set a numerical variable that can be accessed at any time to divert one part of an animation to another, or to a new skill entirely.&nbsp; The skies the limit with these.&nbsp; You can create Transforming characters, set specific functions to happen based on said variable, such as a character's animations changing depending on health level, etc.&nbsp; Use your imagination, chances are you can do it if you use variables.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Random Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="randombox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>Think of this as a dice roll.&nbsp; You can set this condition to load random animations depending on a numeric ratio.&nbsp; These numbers are generated at random during the game.&nbsp; This is ideally used to create multiple win poses or start animations.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Detect Command Input Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="combox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This is another very useful function. This allows you to set a condition that when a command is entered during a skill, the skill can continue, it can divert to another skill, or it can cancel the skill.&nbsp; I typically use these for rapid tap moves, such as Chun-Li's Hyakuretsu Kyaku.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>GoTo Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="sgbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This simply tells a skill to go to another animation when it reaches the point where this function is.&nbsp; It's typically used to loop animations an infinite number of times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Call Skill Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="scbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This will call a skill to activate in the middle of a currently active skill.&nbsp; Not particularly useful, but it can be used during super moves, or character specific special attacks.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>For (Loop) Skill Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="sfbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This can call a specific section of an animation to loop a number of times as determined by the numeric input in the function properties area.&nbsp; This is a fairly useful object when you don't want to waste a character variable to create a loop-then-stop type skill.&nbsp; A typical sort of use would be something like Ken and Ryu's Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku special attack.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Change Shape's Condition Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rcbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This calls a common image for an opposing character during a character's skill.&nbsp; This is typically used during grapples.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Change Skill Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rpbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This is similar to the Change Shape's Condition box, except this time, it calls a hit junction from an opposing character.&nbsp; This is also used during throws, and is typically a bit more useful as it can be applied to many more situations.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Check Special Guages Fork Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="gsbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This allows you to script a condition fork based on how many super stock a character&nbsp; has stored.&nbsp; This is mostly used for determining which attacks drain your special stock, i.e. Super Combos, and by how much.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Check Life Guages Fork Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="glbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This is identical to the Check Special Guages Fork box, except that it uses your character's life guage as a base instead of special stock.&nbsp; This can be used to create a similar situation to the original Art of Fighting series, where as a character took more damage, the more beat up they looked.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Change Guage Value Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="gcbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This allows you to change the current value of your/your enemies Life and Special Stock guages.&nbsp; These could be used during various hit junctions (i.e. being thrown), or similar to a charging animation, a'la King of Fighters.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Background Effects Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="ebbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This is more accurately labeled Special Effects, as it not only deals with the background, but can be applied to a character as well.&nbsp; This allows you to set various special effects such as color fades or camera shakes to be activated during a skill.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Color Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="colorbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This works similarly to the Background Effects box, in that you can apply a color modification to your character.&nbsp; This can be as simple as a hue change, or as complex as a graduated fade (this is achieved by using multiple color functions in one skill).&nbsp; You can also use the Alpha settings to make your character transparent.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Time Stop Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="psbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This allows you to stop time for either you, your enemy, or both of you.&nbsp; This is typically used in combination with a Background Effects box during the beginning of a Super Combo to signal it's use.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>After Images Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="aibox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>Neat? Definitely.&nbsp; Practical? Um... sort of... This is used to create after images that linger after your character during a skill.&nbsp; These can be used to achieve a look of a character moving at immense speeds, or just as a flashy overall effect during skills.&nbsp; A good example is Johnny Cage's Shadow Kick from Mortal Kombat, or the Variable ISM Custom Super Combos from Street Fighter Alpha 2 and 3.&nbsp; Why are they impractical?&nbsp; Well, mostly because they require you to place a condition that will trigger the after images to turn off during all your hit junctions as well as at the end of a skill that uses them so that you won't be stuck with afterimages on every skill after the one that triggered it.&nbsp; The effect is worth it though.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>End Skill Box </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="endskillbox.png" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This is used to tell a skill to end immediately upon reaching this condition.&nbsp; This is typically used for variable related skills such as a transformed character (where you have more than one animation compiled on the same line, but don't want both of them active).&nbsp; You typically don't have much use for it otherwise.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>End Command Box </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="ebox.png" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> This box means that this is the end of the command.&nbsp; Simply place this on the last line of your command.</FONT><BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Wait Dot</B> </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="waitdot.png" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> This is a call back to the Tekken/Virtua Fighter series of games and simply means leave some space between one part of the command and the next.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Input Arrows</B> </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="inputarrows.png" WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>- </B>These are the input arrows for your commands. Each of them responds to the direction needed to be pressed during a command.&nbsp; Click on the </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="free.png" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> a few times to scroll through each of your arrows and set your commands the way you'd like.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Roll Arrows </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rollarrows.png" WIDTH="66" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> These arrows are a bit of help from the people at Enterbrain to it's program's users.&nbsp; Instead of having to place 3 separate arrows to create a "Roll from 'this' to 'this'" command, you simply need to place one of these between the two corresponding lines.&nbsp; These are accessed in the same way your command arrows are. Simply click a few more times.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Input Buttons</B> </FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="commandbuttons.png" WIDTH="97" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> These are the buttons you use for your punches and kicks, but that's not all they're restricted to.&nbsp; You can have each button do something different, it's all up to you.&nbsp; Obviously the six-button setup is intended for those who wish to create a CAPCOM style brawler, but you can use as many or as few of the buttons as you like.&nbsp; Simply click on the button to make it active (they will look like the highlighted buttons in the example.)</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Command Differentials </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="repeatdifferential.png" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">,</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="holddifferential.png" WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">,</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="blankdifferential.png" WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> Anybody remember the pesky kanji from FM95? No? Well good, it was a pain and a half to figure out what those did... Differentials is the name that I give to the three options you have next to your buttons.&nbsp; This is because they do just that, they change the input method of your command.&nbsp; The first (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="repeatdifferential.png" WIDTH="33" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">) refers to repeatedly pressing the key on the corresponding line, the second (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="holddifferential.png" WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">) refers to holding the key down, used for chargeup attacks like anything Guile can do.&nbsp; The third one (</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="blankdifferential.png" WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="16" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">) is a bit of a mystery, however, if it's anything like FM95, it's a rotation differential.&nbsp; It's used for 360° command input.&nbsp; This is incredibly useful for command grapplers. Simply click on the blank box next to your buttons either once, twice, or three times to select a differential.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Now we'll move on to the windows program icons.&nbsp; Many of these are self explanatory, but for sake of completeness and lack of confusion, these icons are as follows:</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Animation Options </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="animbuttons.png" WIDTH="215" HEIGHT="22" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> -</B> These are your basic function buttons used to adjust or test out animations.&nbsp; BMP means Load Bitmap.&nbsp; Pallet loads your characters palette bank so you can edit them,&nbsp; Ani lets you view the animation of the currently selected skill, and Skill list loads up your characters entire skill list in a window to make navigation simpler.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Red New Image Button </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="rednew.png" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="21" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> This button places an image before the box currently selected in the current skill using the image selected in the bitmap.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Green New Image Button </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="greennew.png" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="21" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> This button places an image after the box currently selected in the current skill using the image selected in the bitmap.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Blue Copy Button </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="bluecpy.png" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="21" BORDER="0"></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> -</B> This button replaces the currently selected image in the skill with the image selected in the bitmap.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Image Select Buttons </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="imgselectbuttons.png" WIDTH="85" HEIGHT="22" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> These allow for various methods of selecting frames from a loaded bitmap file.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first button selects the entire bitmap without shrinking the bounding box. The second button shrinks down the bounding box, essentially cropping the selected image so the edges of the sprites are the same as the bounding box.&nbsp; This makes sure there's no wasted space in memory.&nbsp; The third button is a bit of an oddity.&nbsp; While it's clicked on (this is the default setting), the top left pixel of the selected area determines the transparency color.&nbsp; If the button is clicked off, when you insert the bitmap into FM2nd, the sprite has no transparency... this is typically only used with backgrounds, as it produces ugly results with character sprites.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Directory Upload Button </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="directoryupload.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="19" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>Quite a handy function for those of us who don't use sprite sheets.&nbsp; What this button does is allow you to take an entire directory of 256 color bitmaps and load them into your character's image bank with one click.&nbsp; It's a fantastic option if you don't feel like taking hours uploading bitmaps.&nbsp; The only problem with this is you need to make sure each bitmap is perfect before you upload the directory, because otherwise you likely won't be able to find mistakes on your own once in the editor.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Delete Unused Images Button </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="deleteunused.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="19" BORDER="0"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> - </B>This is also a nice little feature.&nbsp; Finish a character and aren't sure what frames of animation never got used??&nbsp; No problem!&nbsp; Click on this and any images loaded into the image bank that aren't actively being used by a skill will be deleted.&nbsp; This will allow you to keep the filesize for your project down.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Palette Banks </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="palettebank.png" WIDTH="218" HEIGHT="22" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> These buttons allow you to select which palette to edit.&nbsp; They correspond to a specific player (1-8), more often than not, you won't see the extra palettes outside of Team Vs. Mode.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Dark To Light </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="darktolight.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> Clicking this button organizes your palette from darkest to lightest colors.&nbsp; Typically though the results are frustratingly hard to work with, but if this is your cup of tea, by all means, go for it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Palette Order </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="paletteorder.png" WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> Clicking this button arranges your color palettes from Monochrome, to Red, to Green, to Blue, in that order, with shades going from light to dark.&nbsp; This is a fairly useful button for when your palette is a bit uncategorized.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Edit </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="paletteedit.png" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> This button opens up the color editor.&nbsp; I never find much need for it, as double clicking a color produces the same result.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>Animation Test Option Buttons </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="3"><IMG SRC="animtestbuttons.png" WIDTH="104" HEIGHT="22" BORDER="0"></FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> <B>-</B> These are used in the Animation test to produce various ways of viewing the animations.&nbsp; The first toggles whether or not to follow the character when movement is involved in the animation.&nbsp; The second toggles collision detection boxes on or off.&nbsp; The third toggles sounds on or off, and the fourth allow you to view an animation in half size in case it goes to high or moves too far out of the field of vision provided (or if you just have a REALLY big special effect).</FONT><BR>
<BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="5"><B>2D Fightermaker 2nd Round - Frequently Asked Questions</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#800000" SIZE="5"><HR></B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">While I certainly hope to have answered as many questions as I can regarding the program, there are a few that will slip by, usually those not having to do with the program itself, but other situations such as communities, where to find the program, resources, etc.&nbsp; I'll cover some of those here.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>1.) Can I post this tutorial on my website?</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Short answer, no.&nbsp; Long answer, as long as you ask me for permission, or I have given consent to you otherwise, then you may post it.&nbsp; Under no other circumstances is this file to be reproduced without my prior consent.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>2.) Where can I download 2D Fightermaker 2nd Round?</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">There are a few places you can get it.&nbsp; My site is not one of them.&nbsp; Both FMHQ and Fighters GX have the program available for download.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>3.) I still don't understand 'X'...</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">If there's something I haven't explained well enough for you, please feel free to get in contact with me about it. The best way to go about this is by sending me a private message at either the FMHQ board, or the Fighters GX board, both of which I frequent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">NOTE: I understand some things can be confusing, but please make sure it's something I have not covered with foolproof instructions.&nbsp; Try out what you want to do a couple times, then if it doesn't work, even with the aid of this document, then message me.&nbsp; I hate to sound rude, but I'd much prefer not to have my inbox flooded.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>4.) Why did you write this tutorial?&nbsp; There are a couple of others available already.</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Well, meaning no disrespect to those who put in work to create a tutorial for the program already, I felt it necessary to crack open the program myself, and write the most thorough tutorial for the program I possibly could.&nbsp; The documents currently available have some sections that weren't as explanatory as I felt they could be.&nbsp; The main reason however, is I owed the community an update.&nbsp; In the amount of time I disappeared, Fightermaker 95 became all but obsolete, and I had never updated the tutorial as promised.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>5.) What took you so long to write this tutorial?</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Believe me... this is one I heard a LOT...&nbsp; The thing is, I'm a normal person like everyone else.&nbsp; Real life can get in the way of things I'd much rather be doing instead.&nbsp; Whether I'm stuck working, or anything else of that nature, it will put my projects on hold.&nbsp; There's really no way around it.&nbsp; It was also an amalgam of other things, whether it be that I was stuck with a technique, something glitched, or I was just straight burned out for the day.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>6.) Will you update <U><I>THIS</I></U> tutorial? (For real this time?)</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I do plan on it, yes.&nbsp; I felt awful about not delivering last time and will do everything in my power to keep this document as up to date as possible.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>7.) You don't have a listing for technique 'X', why is it not included?</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The simple answer is, if it's not here, I haven't figured it out yet.&nbsp; With most techniques, this is the case.&nbsp; There are however, isolated cases where I'm perfecting a technique, and it will be addressed in a later update.&nbsp; If neither of these cases are true, it means I simply haven't tried it yet.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>8.) Can I submit a technique for an update?</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">By all means, feel free to send me your ideas.&nbsp; I will however require an example of the technique (be it a character using it, a stage, or what have you).&nbsp; So do not contact me with something you haven't tried first.&nbsp; You will of course be credited for it.&nbsp; (NOTE: If I figure out an easier way to do said technique, I will append it in the tutorial.&nbsp; The actual technique will still be credited, but I will mention if I have changed anything or not.)&nbsp; Once again, the best way to get in contact with me would be through the forums at FMHQ or Fighters GX.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Once again, I ask, do not send me multiple techniques one right after the other.&nbsp; This tells me two things, either you haven't tested them thoroughly, or you've got more free time than I do.&nbsp; While I do appreciate the effort you've put forth, I don't need to wade through an inbox with 6 pages worth of new messages every day.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><B>9.) Where can I find the forums you keep mentioning?</B></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Fighters GX - I need a new link for this one... my old bookmarks stopped working...&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">FMHQ - </FONT><A HREF="http://www.fmhq.us"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">http://www.fmhq.us</FONT></A><BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">I think that about covers everything.&nbsp; For now at least.&nbsp; And this one wasn't full of BS questions to fill space either! ^_^</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Any further questions will be addressed in later updates as well.</FONT><BR>
